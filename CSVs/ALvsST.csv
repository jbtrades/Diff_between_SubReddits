i went on a long rant in reply to that post and felt strongly about the relevance of making my reply an actual post it a bit of a read but please stay with me post here  this is what legit ufo footage should look like someone who sifts through about anywhere from 5 to 15 or more ufo sighting submission footage segment a day i can tell you that clear legit ufo footage when it doe materialize either get shot down a being cgi or an elaborate hoax and that kind of footage is very rare to say the least when it doe show up for blurred shaky unzoomed footage of thing that either look like blimp silver balloon weather balloon misidentified aircraft or drone they are in the majority and whatever quality the equipment being used is the witness is 99 always freaking out and cant get their s together enough to provide grade a class footage i believe is important is that if there are craft originating from other world or other dimension making trip to our planet zipping around inside our atmospheric envelope is that they are going to look to be characterized by 1 or more of the following distinct trait they will disguise  mimic a a conventional aircraft but maybe performing extraordinarily they wont care about disguise and having advanced tech will look completely baffling  anomalous and maybe performing extraordinarily they will be cloaked invisible to the visible light spectrum maybe will show on ir cam they will appear to phase in and out of existence appear  disappear what is interesting to note is that a lot of the footage i trawl through nearly always exhibit one or more of the above trait it is also essential to not get footage fatigue  you know what i mean right where you have just seen so much footage which ha been called out a being bogus or too blurry or look too much like a blimp or a loon that you prejudge footage before you have given it a fair shake at analysis thats literally throwing the baby out with the bath water you consider yourself more than just a casual ufo topic follower you should also recognize that this is a phenomenon that ha been around since before the first stillcameras and it a much of a headscratcher now a it ha ever been of a mass ufo sighting with many witness taking video  photographic evidence from different angle it will literally take one hanging out or landing in a major city to have the effect of a paradigm shifting wave of revelation  revolutionary impact on the public at large the meantime we are tasked with being vigilant observant and above all patient with what the average joe public submits with ufo footage sorting out the wheat from the chaff so to speak and disseminating it to others for review discovery debate insight identification and education that note i will be getting a sionyx aurorapro night vision camera a soon a they are back in stock they have been sold out nationally for several month a i live in a very active state for sighting this is really great cutting edge

i have a problem with getting behind a hostile alien theory take for example we discover what appears to be an unknown satellite in orbit around earth one day we notice that it’s sending drone craft to monitor our military base so we successfully shoot down a drone to see what it is our government would consider the shooting down of one of our drone an act of war so contemporary thinking suggest that the alien would take our aggression a hostility and perhaps an act of war  though they will interpret our action a that of a chimpanzee stealing a hidden camera the animal they are studying is just curious and is the kind of behaviour they would like to see a part of their scientific study this something we should expect to happen if we ever send probe to another solar system ,jfbpdf,i have a problem with getting behind a hostile alien theory take for example we discover what appears to be an unknown satellite in orbit around earth one day we notice that it’s sending drone craft to monitor our military base so we successfully shoot down a drone to see what it is our government would consider the shooting down of one of our drone an act of war so contemporary thinking suggest that the alien would take our aggression a hostility and perhaps an act of war  though they will interpret our action a that of a chimpanzee stealing a hidden camera the animal they are studying is just curious and is the kind of behaviour they would like to see a part of their scientific study this something we should expect to happen if we ever send probe to another solar system ,0

several month ago ive taken time to let this sink in i wa practicing meditation on a daily basis and had a vision of an et woman during a meditation i wa only trying to relax not make any sort of contact so the experience ha shocked me out of meditation practice ever since an extraordinarily clear image had come into my mind of this woman i can hardly imagine any person or thing in my mind in perfect detail like this wa down to the highlight in her eye and mixed tone of her cheek i only saw her face neck and part of her shoulder she had a soft smile and welcoming expression i almost didnt notice she wasnt human because her feature were so natural on her face they were distinctly alien but subtle enough not to be alarming to overlook even at first glance she wa beautiful for sure almost perfect in composition large and high cheekbone with very full cheek and a tapering jaw an unusually flat nose but she did have one the nostril were smaller than average and more ovaline her lip were thin but she had those too mouth a bit small her eye were definitely larger than normal not massive but at least twice the size of average i didnt see white in her eye they looked dark in color if she had pupil or iris there wa too much light reflecting from her eye for me to tell i noticed the reflection because the largeness and darkness of her eye created a lot more reflectiveness eyeshine than any eye ive seen before she seemed to be in a place with lot of light her eye were slightly angled or catlike on her face just slightly she had eyelash and thin brow her physique looked thin from what i could see she had long perfectly waved hair below the shoulder like a stylist did it up for a tv show or something it wa whiteblonde cooltoned and nearly matched her skin color no bang what i could see of her ear looked normal her coloring wa very odd the best way i could describe it would be ashwhite there were some soft mixed tone in part of her skin like her cheek in bluemauvepurple type color and dash of cooltone pink the rest of her skin wa white like a marshmallow with an odd grayishash tone yet still bright and alive looking she had clothes on but i didnt see any seam and the color wa the same a her skin i didnt notice the background because i wa so compelled by her face and there wasnt enough there to catch my attention i wa not alarmed the whole time i saw her even after realizing she wasnt human it wa after i came out of the meditation that i became alarmed and stopped meditating since then even though she had a friendly feeling about her again it been some time but this wa so vivid like seeing an hd photo i couldnt even see my mom face in a much detail if i tried to envision it and i see her on a daily basis it just came into my mind and wa gone the next moment so striking ive never had an experience like it before or since you dont believe this experience or that this wa a real alien that wont hurt my feeling i almost dont believe it and am still grappling with fitting what this vision entail into my experience of reality should i consider this contact or no id like an outside opinion also if anyone ha had a similar experience or think they know what type of et this is please let me know i know nothing about alien other than this visual i got and if someone ha a theory on why this happened please share otherwise i just wanted to share this visual with others who might have an interest i found someone artwork that is a little bit similar though not the same a what i saw her feature were softer looking not so angled cheek fuller eye bigger and softer and dark color and tone totally different too and the nose wa a little flatter with different nostril her mouth wa similar to this but the lip were a tad thinner and had more coloring similar to the coloring in her cheek she looked more vivid and real than this because this image is only an artist rendition dont know if this matter but im a 23 year old female she actually looked around

otherwise i just wanted to share this visual with others who might have an interest i found someone artwork that is a little bit similar though not the same a what i saw her feature were softer looking not so angled cheek fuller eye bigger and softer and dark color and tone totally different too and the nose wa a little flatter with different nostril her mouth wa similar to this but the lip were a tad thinner and had more coloring similar to the coloring in her cheek she looked more vivid and real than this because this image is only an artist rendition dont know if this matter but im a 23 year old female she actually looked around that age too from  ,0

hi all am in the middle of reading dr john mack book abduction about his extensive research with individual who have experienced alien abduction what i found interesting is that all of the case that ive read so far involve people who have been abducted in the middle of the night usually accompanied by sleep paralysis i have never been abducted myself but i experience sleep paralysis rather frequently which is usually followed by an outofbody experience where i am able to float around my bedroom and house float through the ceiling window and wall sometimes see other being in my room not alien but rather spirit or being who are dark and somewhat transparent during sleep paralysis i used to experience a menacing presence such a a dark figure in my room the hat man or an evil being sitting on my chest trying to suffocate me however after some time these negative experience associated with sleep paralysis stopped now whenever i get sleep paralysis i just leave my body and explore this other strange realm my personal encounter with sleep paralysis and outofbody experience astral projection i am convinced that this other world i experience when i leave my body is another reality perhaps another dimension in many way it feel and look like the real world but at the same time it is slightly off and different i am fully aware and conscious through the whole experience a if i wa in my real body considering the similarity between sleep paralysis and alien abduction im wondering if alien abduction occur in this other dimension a well i know that some people who have experienced humanoid encounter outside the context of nighttimesleep recalled that the being used some sort of tool to paralyze them so that they could not move but their consciousness remained intact and they were aware of what wa going on to me this sound very similar to the experience of sleep paralysis where your body is paralyzed but your mind is completely aware guess i am just thinking aloud and trying to organize my thought around this but i really feel that abduction and perhaps all ufo phenomenon come from a different dimension however the phenomenon is able to manifest itself physically in this dimension a well which would explain our ability to sometimes detect ufo on radar or capture photograph and video of it  i am familiar with jacques vallees interdimensional hypothesis which ha influenced a lot of my own view stated here thanks for reading i would be curious to know your thought and if anyone ha experienced abduction and sleep paralysis on separate occasion id be curious to know what your experience wa like and what you think the connection is between these two phenomenon  just wanted to add that a lot of abductees recall being floated by alien being out of their bed through the wallsceilings of their house this is the same thing that happens when i leave my body due to sleep paralysis i am also able to float through solid object  also some abductees recall hearing a loud vibrating sound when the abduction experience begin likewise many people hear the same sound when they enter sleep paralysis and right before they are able to leave their body

21 yo f curious if anyone on here ha experienced anything similar i dont use reddit much but figured this would be the best place for me to bring these kind of vague question   get right into it for a long a i can remember ive been pretty in tune with thing i wasnt raised spiritual at all though a a kid i always had adult calling me an empath and i had many extremely vivid recurring dream that would actually unfold in real life year down the line  ive never sought out a psychic reading intentionally but somehow every once in a while every couple year maybe more often ill meet a person who tell me some creepily spoton deeply psychic kind of shit  maybe im fucking schizo but im pretty positive that im not and that ive had actual conversation with certain individual telepathically  the first time it happened to me i wa sitting beside my friend after a long day and his voice came through in my mind a clear a day  it scared the shit out of me i ended up cry and coming up with an excuse to leave on the spot because i wa that freaked out  he eventually told me something super cryptic about alien and how im not from here i wrote it off at the time and stopped hanging out with him cause it wa just weird to me but since then ive had even more similar experience with multiple others sometimes it happened with close friend but just a often it will happen with complete stranger  people i dont even have a real opinion about  i happen to be an exotic dancer a well so im constantly meeting random people and nut job  nothing surprise me much anymore ive learned to read people extremely well  yet it still doe a bit when i get this kind of thing because it doesnt happen at work i get stopped on the street randomly in 2016 i hiked part of the pacific crest trail in nevada with a group of friend through the high sierra  on our way into the mountain we saw what we decided at the time had to have been a ufo we saw it shoot across the sky one more time 2 week later on our way out maybe only 5 mile from where we had seen it last  i remember u all losing our mind about it but a the year have gone by i kind of just wrote it off a probably a satellite or a meteor  but why would it have been flying so low and slow saw a similar shape in the sky a week later while we were setting up camp at the base of mt shasta in california  i wa alone that time and i kind of forgot about that too  ive never said anything about this to anyone or even thought about it much till now  i wonder if there something to it  last week i met a masseuse who happened to be a psychic  among other thing she wa able to tell me exactly where my bedroom wa located in my childhood home she knew i had been homeless before in my life and knew i spent some time hiking in the west and even told me someday in the foreseeable future i would find myself in arizona and experience a drastic but ultimately positive life change  eerie stuff ,jdcaaf,21 yo f curious if anyone on here ha experienced

"it could very well be that modern science is wrong about a lot of thing and that ha hindered our ability to replicate the capability that ufo are able to do from what i understand during ww2 the nazi disagreed with a lot of the modern science einstein in particular and perhaps that is what made it possible for them to think outside the box and because of that they were able to come up with anti gravity aircraft paperclip brought in a lot of nazi scientist and very soon after that the crash in roswell happenedim not saying those two are connected but it something worth thinking about 
 is a video of a russian self taught scientist it appears he created  a device that seems to be using anti gravityim not sure if it is fake but it give you something to think about bushman an ex senior scientist with lockheed martin and a video where he drop hint about how ufo work and basically say that the only thing that matter are thing that can actually be test and that theory are just theory proof that einstein wa wrong about his theory of special relativityand that is one of the many thing that scientist are wrong about ",jcmlhm,"it could very well be that modern science is wrong about a lot of thing and that ha hindered our ability to replicate the capability that ufo are able to do from what i understand during ww2 the nazi disagreed with a lot of the modern science einstein in particular and perhaps that is what made it possible for them to think outside the box and because of that they were able to come up with anti gravity aircraft paperclip brought in a lot of nazi scientist and very soon after that the crash in roswell happenedim not saying those two are connected but it something worth thinking about

 feel morally obligated to say the following view is first and foremost that christianity is true and if christianity is true then the bible is true and if the bible is true then there are spirit who follow god and there are spirit who rebel against him in the same way that there are human being who follow god and human being who do not that follow god are angel spirit who dont follow god are fallen angel demon or unclean spirit these three term refer to the same being by the way all of my christian doctrine come from william lane craig a foremost christian philosopher theologian and apologist he ha a phd in philosophy and theology he actually ha an entire course on christian doctrine for free on his website  i suggest all of you go through it he even ha a section that cover demon are nonphysical unembodied mind in secular term i suppose one could view them a interdimensional being they dont normally have body but they can manifest them this raise an interesting question do they have limit on what they can manifest a the bible never answer this question these being are incredibly intelligent knowledgeable powerful and old created before u they do not die like we do they can also perform supernatural feat the bible state for our struggle is not against enemy of blood and flesh but against the ruler against the authority against the cosmic power of this present darkness against the spiritual force of evil in the heavenly place ephesian 612 meaning there are evil spiritual force behind the power structure and government of the world isnt from science the pentagon or ufo researcher this is from a revelation given to you by god over the course of human history one study and correctly understands the bible then theyd more or le get a picture of the world that is similar to what people like jacques vallee and tom delonge have obtained in other way unfortunately delonge and many others seemed to have fallen into the trap of thinking if some religion are false or are being used by evil to control people then therefore they must all be false ironically if the bible is true then this is exactly what satan and his angel want assuming christianity is true then we should expect there to be false religion philosophy and cult created by the enemy to erode the truth leading people astray recommendation is to keep it simple because were dealing with being who are incredibly evil and intelligent focus on who jesus is what he taught and what he ha done for u ",jce55t,"tom delonge obtained and released those u military ufo video that have since then been

is to shine a light on the fact that delonge ha friend and contact in high place within the government military and nasa therefore we should seriously consider the information he ha shared with the public the following is a list of claim by delonge information that he alleges came from government and military official during the cold war 19471991 nonhuman entity whether it be uap or otherwise is never mentioned were disabling and activating nuclear weapon system inside the u and the russian could detect when these system were activated delonges contact said the russian could have very well reacted by launching their nuclear missile but didnt after these event the u started developing way to prevent this from happening in the future the u ha instrument that monitor and analyze the electromagnetic spectrum of aerospace and it ha picked up uap leaving and entering the earth atmosphere there are special time referred to a episodic when a great number of uap will leave or enter the earth atmosphere there ha been more than one ufo crash crash have been going on since at least the 1940s if the general public understood what wa going on then there would be an influx of interest in space exploration and space defense similar to how there wa an influx of people joining the u military after the september 11 attack the u is developing antigravity technology internally alien arent referred to a alien or the phenomenon instead theyre referred to a the others delonges contact have told him that these being are like god and that theyre warring with each other behind the scene the others are manipulating the government of the world with false religion and other system of control with the intent of inciting war the others have purposely crashed ufo in country with the goal of passing on dangerous technology while simultaneously perpetuating the idea that alien are flying around in spaceship delonge say that when the u take an interest in a country like north korea it may be because that country ha obtained dangerous alien technology the others are apparently comprised of different specie and some look very human but it unclear how much of what they look like is for deception or infiltration purpose delonge belief grey are android ancient story about god interacting with human being and human being worshiping them are literal the u government is aware of the machination of the others but it isnt clear to them how much other government know hence the secrecy who ha more alien technology how much do other government know who is being manipulated is anyone allied with the others the others are behind cattle mutilation and abduction delonge speculates that these being feed off evilnegativity metal have been recovered from some of these ufo crash with atomic structure that indicate that they were artificially made in zerogravity environment atlantis wa real and the greek god were actually the others the others would sometimes artificially push civilization forward by releasing knowledge or technology there wa ancient greek writing on the roswell wreckage the idea presented in the movie arrival 2016 about vision time and an international coalition for studying alien is on par with reality in 2013 over a third of nato nuclear weapon at sea were simultaneously shut down by ufo and the system in space that control these weapon were also being shut down at least the u russia and china have alien technology either by accident unintentional ufo crash or by design intentional ufo crash delonge say country like the u russia and china were given tech by the others to see who is stronger exact quote he received the others and the unclean spiritsfallen angel described in the bible sound extremely similar the disappearance or destruction of certain ancient civilization may have been due to the others either directly or indirectly there are secret underground base that specialize in working on alien technology and defense against the

it more plausible than not that not all unidentified flying object and unidentified aerial phenomenon are natural humanmade or hallucination this lead to the idea that some ufo and uap are being generated by a nonhuman consciousness or is a nonhuman consciousness in itself currently the most popular branch from this idea is that were being visited by a biological nonhuman consciousness from a different planet some even go a far a to assume this biological nonhuman consciousness is benevolent i view these two popular notion a implausible for the following reason have been too many landing and close encounter if were dealing with a visiting biological nonhuman consciousness then why is it taking so long for them to catalog the biological life and feature of the earth surely an advanced civilization capable of traveling light year through space must have completed this catalog by now whats more shouldnt they posse the capability to monitor and study earth from afar in the same that we do to other planet and shouldnt they have the capability to collect and analyze the multitude of information about the earth and it inhabitant that weve been broadcasting via radio wave for the past 100 year the point here is that these being should have at least the same capability that we do for gathering information on top of whatever capability a civilization capable of traveling light year would have theyve also had a lot of time to gather information about the earth and it inhabitant remember there have been sighting and close encounter with socalled alien for hundred if not thousand of year yet many people today still encounter these being landing and performing menial task like collecting soil civilization capable of traveling light year probably ha the technology to correct or at least relieve some of human suffering if were to believe that an advanced civilization ha and is still visiting the earth then why hasnt it helped human being in any substantial way i believe we can all agree that human being are morally flawed but many human being love and care for animal and are compassionate enough to help them doe this mean were morally superior to whatever civilization ha been visiting u some have argued that perhaps this civilization doesnt interfere in this way for fear of impeding our spiritual or psychological growth but couldnt they help u in such a way a to not impede our spiritual or psychological growth in the same way a math teacher might help his student with a word problem without giving away the answer therefore there doesnt seem to be any good reason for their apparent indifference towards human suffering explanation like there might be some intergalactic agreement where theyre not allowed to interfere is ad hoc on the contrary if abduction account are to be believed then these being appear to be malicious when they arent randomly appearing to people in the sky leaving behind more question than answer then theyre kidnapping

agreement where theyre not allowed to interfere is ad hoc on the contrary if abduction account are to be believed then these being appear to be malicious when they arent randomly appearing to people in the sky leaving behind more question than answer then theyre kidnapping people and animal from their home and conducting experiment on them ,0

if we look back over time given all the evidence that ha been collected from all over our planet and where the public have repeatedly been given false hope of disclosure it seems fairly clear that something extraordinary is going to have to take place before the gatekeeper of the worst kept secret in history provide u with the information we both demand and deserve if we look at the massive amount of effort taken to suppress deflect ridicule obfuscate and misdirect anyone that seek to gather or prove the existence of irrefutable evidence that the ufo phenomenon is real we can clearly see a pattern of behaviour that thus far ha done a terrible job in keeping these secret mainly because those people that have experienced something incredible want to talk about it make sense of it understand how their experience fit into their version of reality these are profound and important event that deeply affect the people who live through them and there are literally million of people around our planet that have been witnessing the incredible over decade perhaps century we know that this phenomenon and our understanding of it possibly represents a complete paradigm shift in our sociological and cultural development  too long though we have relied on key individual to move u closer to disclosure but the proof is out there right in front of u they are our neighbour our family our friend the very people in our community that have these incredible story to tell and all we need do is listen some of them may work in government or the military or your local grocery store but for all those people that are either experiencers or witness or have secret they wish to tell in the end it will be these people collectively that show u the truth these people deserve answer or redemption they deserve their peace of mind  when i think about the history of ufo sighting i am moved to consider those individual faced with the extraordinary abandoned to ridicule stigma and a lifetime of question and i mourn the fact that these people aren’t heralded respected and given the support they so rightly need  think that anyone that can do anything regardless of their background to further the education awareness and understanding of the issue should be encouraged and supported wholeheartedly the ufo community is a cynical bruised and untrusting one at time and for good reason but sometimes along the way we forget why we are so passionate about learning the truth and how that truth is revealed we care because this is the most important question of our time and it is blatantly obvious that there are those among u that either through direct experience or by being privy to data know much more than they are telling u i believe that within the ttsa there are people that fit this description  think that through community action petition contacting local govt official raising awareness there is a way to collectively help tip the momentum in the favour of those that deserve the truth i think falling into destructive divisive cynical behaviour so often characterised in typical online discourse is exactly what we are expected to do but if we work together support those on our side and keep remembering why we’re doing this and the experiencers we need to serve we can all do our part collectively to move towards a time when we can share our knowledge

now i’ve never really thought this wa abduction related at all even now i’m just playing around with the idea after hearing a lot of different story on abduction and how memory can be altered apparently i wa around 1213 when this happened i’m in bed and there’s a window directly to the foot of the bed sometimes i used to leave the blind open i also used to sleep with my dog every night i wake up one night to my dog going nut barking and growling after looking i can see he’s on the floor facing the window so i look up to the window and there is this huge black figure it wa probably 7ft to 8ft and well built so naturally i start screaming and ran a fast a could to my parent room and i remember open their door then blackness i wake up the next morning back in my bed i ask my parent the next morning what happened last night they have no idea what i’m talking about  before you say wa probably a dream it wasn’t i know what a dream is like this wa awake and terrified i can still remember it vividly i’m just playing around with the idea when i wa younger i just thought it wa some creeper peering in my window but it wa just so strange how my parent can’t remember any of that’s the only part that make me think ,jb14g8,now i’ve never really thought this wa abduction related at all even now i’m just playing around with the idea after hearing a lot of different story on abduction and how memory can be altered apparently i wa around 1213 when this happened i’m in bed and there’s a window directly to the foot of the bed sometimes i used to leave the blind open i also used to sleep with my dog every night i wake up one night to my dog going nut barking and growling after looking i can see he’s on the floor facing the window so i look up to the window and there is this huge black figure it wa probably 7ft to 8ft and well built so naturally i start screaming and ran a fast a could to my parent room and i remember open their door then blackness i wake up the next morning back in my bed i ask my parent the next morning what happened last night they have no idea what i’m talking about  before you say wa probably a dream it wasn’t i know what a dream is like this wa awake and terrified i can still remember it vividly i’m just playing around with the idea when i wa younger i just thought it wa some creeper peering in my window but it wa just so strange how my parent can’t remember any of that’s the only part that make me think ,0

so we all know the most common alien encounter are from the grey i have always wondered what planet they come from and i think it must be near earth  we look into how the grey are ‘built’ or what people say they look like  average grey alien is like 5ft big black eye and a skinny hairless body  skinny body and height point to a planet with lower gravity to earth because they obviously don’t need big bone and muscle to move  let’s look at the eye they are all black meaning their eye take in a lot of light this mean the planet ha to be darker than earth and not get much sunlight  to a conclusion is that the grey are from a planet out are solar system but they have a base on the moon the moon seems a better place for them to build a base they could be on the other side of the moon and this is would also explain the frequent encounter to earth  theory could tie in to the reason why u human don’t go back to the moon more often a theory so if u have any idea feel free to comment  💫 ,jaztpy,so we all know the most common alien encounter are from the grey i have always wondered what planet they come from and i think it must be near earth  we look into how the grey are ‘built’ or what people say they look like  average grey alien is like 5ft big black eye and a skinny hairless body  skinny body and height point to a planet with lower gravity to earth because they obviously don’t need big bone and muscle to move  let’s look at the eye they are all black meaning their eye take in a lot of light this mean the planet ha to be darker than earth and not get much sunlight  to a conclusion is that the grey are from a planet out are solar system but they have a base on the moon the moon seems a better place for them to build a base they could be on the other side of the moon and this is would also explain the frequent encounter to earth  theory could tie in to the reason why u human don’t go back to the moon more often a theory so if u have any idea feel free to comment  💫 ,0

so im a fan of science im at a university i do well in my class im not religious but im spiritual i respect everyones preference when it come to that i dont know if there is a god but i believe in good and bad energy and a higher power anyways   all life isare composed of microbe cell like prokaryotic bacteria and eukaryotic animal to in include human there are speculation of harmful microbe bacteria and virus that are sent from space and dispursed into earth from alien some say hitler received higher technology from alien and thats why german innovation wa on top and why hitler had wa so desperate meticulous and secret about space and extraterrestrial encounter so think why is there trouble getting a vaccine created for covid19 during a time when weve surpassed and obtained so much tech the world population ha become so diverse genetically variety of genetic structure from person to person allows for microbe mutation while these cell are always advancing and adapting we are not so if we all had the same genetic structure and sequence it would be so easy to come up with vaccine for anything and everything  if we all had the same genetic structure and wanted to live forever we could do that a that society kinda it would be easy to navigate with our tech and science today for 1 specie 1 genome sequence and just 1 overall being of type in a decade if all science and math from around the world wa dedicated  to advancement of 1 specific race you could know how to not only stop organ failure but reverse it kick on the immune system with science based medicine be able to preserve skin bone and have anti aging over all this is possible but only for 1 specie which is sad to say but 1 specie in dominance may mean living eternally which may be why hitler may have believed that there wa a master race why supremacy wa founded and exist so we a human could of been able to reach such dominance but without a mass extinction it wouldnt be possible so essentially the human race will one day become extinct due to having so many variation of genetic sequencing we will never be able to keep up with more advanced microbe that can always adapt evolve and thrive this bring me to my last point it evident that within the next 100 year human will be extinct due to the circumstance mentioned above and the only way that the human race will succeed is with 1 with surving pure race that will become self sufficient but the only way it can be brought on is by another holocaust so knowing all of this  and putting it together the existence of white supremacy or a master race is stupid because we have long surpassed that chance because we have become so diverse we may also have been told this through profecies of a master race by following the story  of adam and eve and how we reproduced i wa writing an essay for my class about covid and it wa so weird within 05 second all of this clicked in my head ,jayqnd,so im a fan of science im at a university i do well in my class

im assuming here that alien with an essentially similar biology to life on earth do exist and this doesnt mean that i think all life ha to have nucleoside and peptide here on earth human are amongst the longer lived animal i will say that human evolution should continue in the direction of greater longevity a it should for more advanced specie in general a longevity is a feature i believe of civilisation and high intelligence  it in the first place requires time and a lot of experimentation and experience to acquire expertise if human had the equivalent life of 300 year 200 of which academically and vocationally and what kind of society that would create is a problem though human reach a physical limit around 80 to 100 year of age or about 3 generation of the family being alive simultaneously the peak age for scientific work i believe is around 36 year of age imagine if da vinci had another 100 year at his peak limitation is ultimately due to genetic deterioration we are comprised of two genetic machine one which is the nuclear dna and the other is the mitochondrial dna to reduce aging which is particularly rapid in the mitochondrial dna the cell in our body undergo a process whereby damaged and dysfunctional mitochondrion are digested and removed from the pool the healthy survives fuse and replicate to replace the damaged one this still however doesnt work well enough and so mitochondrial aging is a key feature of aging a is now believed solution an alien could have is the ability to traffic pristine fresh mitochondrion maintained in a special reservoir so that the rate of mitochondrial aging wa much le these would be distributed to invigorate the pool of aged mitochondrion in each cell alternatively the mitochondrial dna can be backed up in the nuclear dna addition to this a second nucleus in each cell might function a a backup to the first allowing periodic gene repair that are more effective at repairing the data the second one could also replicate maybe once every few decade it would be otherwise sealed off to a greater extent protected from free radical and virus this would have to involve a superior membrane of some kind within the cell better gene repair and gene protection can be imagined course a bizarre feature of eukaryote in earth is that they have this dual system of mitochondrion derived from bacteria and nuclear dna it possible to imagine there might be other arrangement out there but it work because the mitochondrion generate energy and hence decay very fast and so cannot be using the same nuclear dna they evolved fast a bacteria however  by removing the damaged mitochondrion and allowing the survivor to replicate a process that involves the ability of the mitochondrion to generate a membrane potential is able to work quite well over the human life span but start running out by the senior year i believe what we would see is that long lived alien might have a strategy to preserve their genetic material

have you noticed how our technology ha evolved lately today there are already robot capable of shooting jumping and communicating with other robot through telepathy the robot literally have an infinite mind of knowledge being much more efficient than u there is also a probability of being our own creation from a distant future after all to wander through space without causing any type of bodily harm would be very difficult even more so at a great speed who know the alien are not actually our own creation in the distant future coming the earth give u knowledge because we know the technology earlier we improve it sooner we will create them sooner what would we do if we didn’t have those god in the past giving u mathematical astronomical and geographic knowledge evolved isnt it a lot of people believe that robot will dominate the world someday it may be true we are nothing to them in that future they may have already destroyed u and are and returned to another planet but for some reason they needed our specie they needed to give u knowledge earlier would it be just an ambition to improve themselves or is there any other reason why they need u a robotic mind is capable of storing million and million data and access all of them easily it wouldnt be difficult for them to travel through space and discover thing that we have tried to do for century and the alien are our own creation of a distant future after all if they arrived here a our own creation declaring themselves robot from a distant future made by our race would we stop making them or would we continue to risk creating our own extinction it would be easier to arrive a god and give u knowledge to improve their world no  ,jaavq2,have you noticed how our technology ha evolved lately today there are already robot capable of shooting jumping and communicating with other robot through telepathy the robot literally have an infinite mind of knowledge being much more efficient than u there is also a probability of being our own creation from a distant future after all to wander through space without causing any type of bodily harm would be very difficult even more so at a great speed who know the alien are not actually our own creation in the distant future coming the earth give u knowledge because we know the technology earlier we improve it sooner we will create them sooner what would we do if we didn’t have those god in the past giving u mathematical astronomical and geographic knowledge evolved isnt it a lot of people believe that robot will dominate the world someday it may be true we are nothing to them in that future they may have already destroyed u and are and returned to another planet but for some reason they needed our specie they needed to give u knowledge earlier would it be just an ambition to improve themselves or is there any other reason why they need u a robotic mind is capable of storing million and million data and access all of them easily it wouldnt be difficult for them to travel through space and discover thing that we have tried to do for century and the alien are our own creation of a distant future after all if they arrived here a our own creation declaring themselves robot from a distant future made by our race would we stop making them or would we continue to risk creating our own extinction it would be easier to arrive a god and give u knowledge to improve their world no  ,0

hi all just learned about the sargent jonathan lovette story in a comment left by someone who had posted on the cattle mutilation thread a few day ago so i am not sure if this is a wellknown case around here or not i found his human abduction  mutilation story incredibly fascinating since lovette’s abduction and mutilation experience had a credible witness it is also interesting how the human mutilation is very similar to the cattle mutilation let me know what you all think and if you know of any similar human abduction  mutilation story there must be hundred of such case but they are probably covered up andor ignored is the video the strange death of jonathan lovette ,ja28z9,hi all just learned about the sargent jonathan lovette story in a comment left by someone who had posted on the cattle mutilation thread a few day ago so i am not sure if this is a wellknown case around here or not i found his human abduction  mutilation story incredibly fascinating since lovette’s abduction and mutilation experience had a credible witness it is also interesting how the human mutilation is very similar to the cattle mutilation let me know what you all think and if you know of any similar human abduction  mutilation story there must be hundred of such case but they are probably covered up andor ignored is the video the strange death of jonathan lovette ,0
tldr since some commenters wont read the full thing  official and respected researcher talking le about alien and more about crazy shit like greek god returning deity mental perception manipulation altered shared universal consciousness and shit like that scare the fuck out of me really good video not mine giving clarity to my whole rant below is here   a bit of context and background re my belief ive always been fascinated with ufo alien stuff like the nazca line cryptids pyramid etc ever since i wa a teen and received my first time life mystery of the unknown volume but it always been in the back of my head like heh thatd be cool if it were true not skeptical more like open to the possibility of it all but not entirely convinced either you might say didnt come from a religious family but i attended plenty of church staying saturday overnight with friend of various belief catholic southern baptist presbyterian methodist jewish even hindi and muslim i wa accepting of all a equal friend and by proxy respected their belief a well i myself developed my own spiritual belief in part because of how contradictory yet also similar a well a sometimes hypocritical these theological viewpoint were to me if there were a universal creator they didnt love this side over that this religion or people over that were all their child after learning more throughout my life the way some religion would poach and then twist the idea and concept of others and make them their own especially christianity i had a falling out with spiritualism for the most part  guess id say im agnostic with a hint of athiest i believe insomething i just dont know what forward a number of decade the recent influx of ufo activity foia document release and nondenialspartial admittance by certain government ha brought me back to the world of the unknown yet this entire time ive been excited for the prospect that life elsewhere is likely extraterrestial and we have brotherssistersfriendsenemies among the star but i always kept in mind these would be completely alien people technology etc meaning not of this earth but part of our shared reality just much further away i took a sort of comfort in that and made peace with it a long time ago okay so were not alone in the universe so what ufo  extraterrestrial alien period then i found this and other sub watching the more respected youtubers and listening to podcasts etc once i started learing about all the what id call fringe theoriesdiscussionsinterdimensional being being from parallel timestreams or universe time traveller existing terrestrial entity mental projection and shared consciousness stuff i started going okay this shit getting wayyy too tinfoilhatty for me and almost dipped out then i listened to an interview with tom delonge and it nearly sealed that deal for me he go on about the being showing u what they think we can understand about greek god returning about all this mental projection stuff which i started dismissing and then he said something that almost frightened me when i learned the truth i couldnt sleep for three day straight this is a man surrounded by highlevel intelligence people military personnel respected scientist people who you think would be the first to dismiss all this oogey boogey stuff and go no it just alien but they havent and thats when the fear started to settle in a bit came the sheer terror to which i still dont know how to process jacques vallees whitepaper  five argument against the extraterrestrial origin of unidentified flying object which is a really good read but maddening but one thing for certain that terror it ha instilled in me it go back to that whole religious learning experience when i wa younger for once something i wa sure wa just built on human ignorance misunderstanding greed and a need for control over others that something being religion in generalnow i wasnt so sure and that frightened me i thought i had it all figured out and in some way mocked those of the past that either a let a simple explainable thing become the basis for crazy religion or b let people like me who knew it wa bull exploit the more ignorant mass own fear to hold control over them i felt man people could be gullible back then and even now in believing all this religious garbage and for the very first time in a long time i felt that very same fear that sheer terror that being we cant explain cant comprehend whose very appearance would likely drive u mad if we ever saw their true form not only exist contradicting everything ive believed for nearly my entire life and when you hear tom delonge speak about those type of entity you can slightly hear that same fear in his voice especially when he talked about what kept him up those night learning everything you thought you knew wa way off the mark and that to me is truly terrifying to jacques vallee reading his paper made me feel sick to the stomach he been one of the most respected name in this field for nearly half a century he should be the first guy to reinforce my original idea that yeah there no crazy deitylevel shit going on here it just alien from other world or under our sea but he the exact oppoite and thats what brought about my fear full circle even this man is saying theyre possibly entity manipulating how our mind perceive them to not drive u insane theyre essentially god from other realmsdimensions who are so advanced so beyond u that again our mind have to be manipulated to comprehend them or they really are extraterrestrial but the same concept of mental image manipulation applies anyall of these fall outside my purview of logic reasoning or even understanding and akin to our ancestor that same fear is swelling to me is the most paralyzing concept of all this is your rational mind go well it could be either a b c d e or f but obviously not g all of the above but from what im hearingreading from respected source that are in the know a lot more than you or i it very well might be leaning more towards g and a i felt a a child first hearing about all these competingopposing force that instill the fear a child is expected to feel a fear i lost a innocence waned and i grew more confident in my belief a i got older that same childfear is whats coming back many year later and i honestly dont know how to feel beyond just plain scared gonna go crawl under my blankey with my nitelite now if i can even sleep that is guy i wanna thank you all for your word of wisdom encouragement and support truthfully most of my fear talk is hyperbole im not literally paralyzed by these idea hiding under the bed waiting to be sucked into the fifth dimension or smote by zeusjupiter it just a i stated in the comment we went from the

especially one with access to high level intel folk and goverment affiliate like delongettsa start throwing these concept out in normal conversation thats whats quoteunquote terrifying  im really really hoping the alien the government ha been in contact with are just prankster fucking with u like gullible human yo zarnax let see if theyll believe this shit too cuz if i find out jesus wa an

hello all  let me just say that i do believe in the existence of alien and i think it quite possible that they have even visited earth and contacted human however i do not much believe the supposed evidence which is alleged to prove their existence even if alien have visited earth or contacted human their nature is so otherworldly that it would be impossible to distinguish such a phenomenon from mere hallucination there are some genuine unidentified flying object which i think could be alien but again i do not think there is sufficient evidence to declare that they are alien i do not believe the evidence should be dismissed outright only that it should be viewed a ambiguous and ultimately inconclusive however i am not here to argue over this think there is a dangerous side to wild speculation about alien alien may be used to form counterconspiracies  that is fake conspiracy theory created to distract from the truth look at area 51 for example the alien conspiracy theory draw away from it true function a an experimental weapon testing center the u government could be spying on u or planning to bomb u with every manner of experimental satellite and people might think instead of alien when they observe such thing in the sky thus the government can then quietly admit the existence of these experimental weapon program and conspiratorial type may think they are clever for ignoring this and focusing instead on the real story  the alien counterconspiracy similarly alien conspiracy theorist wind up chasing after some esoteric shadow order a opposed to the real power elite in society the powerful can perpetuate stereotype of these alienlizardmenilluminati type conspiracy theorist to associate anyone skeptical of the status quo with crackpot and to subtly sway the skeptical towards such crackpot theory this serf a a counterconspiracy because it ultimately strengthens the position of the elite  about alien having constructed the pyramid or the easter island statue can also serve a counterconspiracies a they erase the history of the people who constructed them and thus unintentionally help to perpetuate racist narrative people also say this about stonehenge so i cant say it always racist but regardless it still disrespect the ingenuity and resourcefulness of humanity  not to mention that it totally false  are your thought ,j9zfmp,hello all  let me just say that i do believe in the existence of alien and i think it quite possible that they have even visited earth and contacted human however i do not much believe the supposed evidence which is alleged to prove their existence even if alien have visited earth or contacted human their nature is so otherworldly that it would be impossible to distinguish such a phenomenon from mere hallucination there are some genuine unidentified flying object which i think could be alien but again i do not think there is sufficient evidence to declare that they are alien i do not believe the evidence should be dismissed outright only that it should be viewed a ambiguous and ultimately inconclusive however i am not here to argue over this think there is a dangerous side to wild speculation about alien alien may be used to form counterconspiracies  that is fake conspiracy theory created to distract from the truth look at area 51 for example the alien conspiracy theory draw away from it true function a an experimental weapon testing center the u government could be spying on u or planning to bomb u with every manner of experimental satellite and people might think instead of alien when they observe such thing in the sky thus the government can then quietly admit the existence of these experimental weapon program and conspiratorial type may think they are clever for ignoring this and focusing instead on the real story  the alien counterconspiracy similarly alien conspiracy theorist wind up chasing after some esoteric shadow order a opposed to the real power elite in society the powerful can perpetuate stereotype of these alienlizardmenilluminati type conspiracy theorist to associate anyone skeptical of the status quo with crackpot and to subtly sway the skeptical towards such crackpot theory this serf a a counterconspiracy because it ultimately strengthens the position of the elite  about alien having constructed the pyramid or the easter island statue can also serve a counterconspiracies a they erase the history of the people who constructed them and thus unintentionally help to perpetuate racist narrative people also say this about stonehenge so i cant say it always racist but regardless it still disrespect the ingenuity and resourcefulness of humanity  not to mention that it totally false  are your thought ,0
im recently getting into the evidence of alien existing mostly brought on by this episode of jre id like to discus the movement action and decision of the tic tac discussed by cmdr david fravor cmdr david fravor description of the event start at 740 in the episode  in the jre episode cmdr david fravor describes the classic tic tac ufo darting back and forth over the water off the coast of san diego almost vibrating over the water and creating some sort of noticeable disturbance he decides to circle the ufo and begin descending towards it it then responds instantly matching the circular movement of his plane he decides to cut across the circle to try and get closer to it the ufo accelerates crossing the nose of his plane then completely disappears it then reappears on radar exactly at his cappoint the original location he wa tasked to hold forty mile south of his ship the tic tac wa doing something over the water it noticed it wa being observed responded by matching the flight path must have scanned or somehow understood the mission objective of the plane then disappears to that objective this implies some natural curiosity to me hearing this description my main question start at the beginning of the cmdrs observation the tic tac is bouncing around hovering over the water why would an advanced alien spaceship perform these movement  fir thought that crossed my mind wa timedilation if this ship wa moving at any percentage of the speed of light it is possible that time is moving much faster for the passenger on that ship why doe this matter if the ufo come down to earth and spends a few hour in our time vibrating off the coast of a major city the passenger of that ufo could have day or even month of time researching computing theorizing analyzing studying u that is my interpretation at least alien are here simply to observe u maybe to see if we are worthy of something they can give u a ive dug deeper on the internet it is likely they have been observing u since the begging of humanity going back a far a who fucking know this timedilation give them an incredible defensive advantage imagine having a fight with someone but from your perspective they are fighting in slowmotion any potential attack is seen coming and avoided with ease there is really no threat to you even if your attacker ha big gun and is hostile when cmdr david fravor made his move to descend in a circular motion towards the craft the tic tac might have had many minute or hour to consider his intent it decides to mirror his movement an obvious sign of intelligence or even attempted communication to me then the cmdr cut across the circle the tic tac may have potentially seen this a hostile it scan his ship discovers the goal of his mission simply to find out why or what the cmdr wa doing the tic tac disappears and go to check out what the cmdr wa sent to check out this decision making seems to me to imply the tic tac really just want to know thing the intent seems very much based in observation and avoidance of conflict conclusion considering timedilation do any event or ufo sighting start to make moreless sense i started to think that if they have been observing u since the start of humanity maybe they are also recording our history maybe they are 3d scanning rendering and recording a complete virtual history i think it possible that this is what they want to give u a true and complete record of our origin since they havent made public contact this would also mean we simply arent ready for that information how do we become ready for that information do we need to invent a technology make world peace create an ai  with thing that are not super concrete your mind can really go in any direction let me know what you think thanks for

im not sure if this is the right place for this since i cant determine if this is a ufo subreddit or one about the genuine search for life of our current effort ive been wondering is there really any point to it im not debating the usefulness of finding alien i mean what could we really know even if we did find an exoplanet with life on it how could we study it it not like we could look at the alien through a telescope or collect sample from their homeworld yeah we may know that alien are there but then what whats the followup we could do nothing more it would be the end of the search for extraterrestrial life beyond our solar system yeah we could find more planet but so what how many people do you know of that care when a new exo planet is discovered the only time it ever make the news is if the planet may be habitable yeah an inhabited planet may be an interesting discovery but thats because it would be new nobody going to care if it becomes the norm  only thing that would really be worthwhile is finding life within our own solar system of course the chance of that are slim and it appears scientist are falling back on the speculation of laypeople that alien may be hiding inside europa and other icy moon i dont see the point in scanning extrasolar planet to see if they may have life it not like we could know more than that theyre there and to be honest we would never know that 100 just because we dont understand why a planet atmosphere ha a strange chemistry to it doesnt mean there isnt a nonbiological explanation i mean scientist cant even explain the chemistry of the atmosphere of body within our own solar system yeah they have no explanation for the chemistry of the atmosphere of venus and titan but youre still labeled a crackpot if you say it must be alien unless we seriously take a sample of these world atmosphere and check them for germ well never know 100 if these world host life we obviously cant do that with an extrasolar planet  i think the only search for alien life should stick to world we can at least send probe to of course operation like seti are also a worthwhile endeavor even if theyve come up completely empty despite decade of searching either way it would probably be a wise idea to keep a lookout for any possible invader we may or may not be able to do much about them but having forwarning is better than nothing i just think searching for life outside the solar system is pointless and were not technologically advanced enough to really get anything out of it until we can send probe out to the star we should probably stick to searching for radio signal and doublechecking our own solar system for life ,j9ojrv,im not sure if this is the right place for this since i cant determine if this is a ufo subreddit

i posted this earlier in a comment chain and felt it wa important enough to make an entire post about it somewhere it can gain traction  it regarding the delayed release of the calvine ufo pic touted by nick pope by the ministry of defense for an additional 50 year be aware im not a person in the know im not affiliated with any government or organization i cant verify any of this but the logic at least to me is sound and i hope some of you agree in case youve missed the controversy see the original pic here and here and the story here i may play devil advocate here i dont think the halting of the release is anything sinister me out already on a path of slow disclosure by some of the world government including the u and the uk only all the medium file theyve released so far have been let just say not great there a reason for that it a giant game of follow the leader in a sense with the admission from the pentagon the ttsa series unidentified the phenomenon potential microbial life in venus atmosphere 24 superhabitable world discovered unlimited energy from graphene etc over the past three year theyre slowly dipping our toe into the disclosure pool heck it why tucker carlson ha been pushing it a much a he ha lately to reach the most stubborn unbelieving audience the evangelical conservative group if you look at all the release how theyre timed which market theyre reaching it a puzzle slowly being formed with piece dropping here and there the whole picture will emerge sooner than later because it ha to private industry and corporate interest are chomping at the bit to get in on the ground floor of whatever tech is coming like zero point energy stuff weve reverse engineered look at the tr3a aurora and tr3b astra both have been in use for quite some time the military is dying to roll these out to the mass military industrial complex other government in the know are likely ready to start a proxy bidding war for their right to own these fantastic machine but revealing where the tech came from thats the problem they have to get humanity used to the idea of confirmed extraterrestial life to minimize chaos and confusion around the globe and once that cork pop a lot of question hard question are going to be asked long did you know and keep it secret else arent you telling u we in danger are alien preparing to attack did they come from are they cousin friend enemy have they always been here list go on and on so before a new age of industry commercial and otherwise can begin they have to reveal at least a rough outline of the truth and therein lie the problem what i said about it being a game of follow the leader thats what the world government are doing waiting for the u to make the big leap into the deep end if these photo if you believe nick pope are a clear concise and undeniable a he say it would entail the uk making the first technical move which they are not prepared to do and a he himself stated i believe the majority of the british populace is a lot harder to accept change than even the staunchest republican or christian when they set the original release date they were expecting u to be through this process already disclosure should have happened by now if you look at the expiration date on a lot of foia released document it wa planned for a while back so the private sector could start making use of the tech but of course humanity and our stubbornness got in the way so until we get a much broader fuller disclosure they cant afford for truly authentic clear high resolution picture and video to be released this new date doesnt mean it going to be another fifty year think of it more like when mickey mouse trademark wa set to expire disney got a renewal of it against the norm because of how iconic he is and his monetary value this

"  let me start by saying i live in the panhandle in florida it wa easter sunday around 1999 about 5 pm so still daylight outside and i wa about 8 year old i had went to my grandmother house next door to my house and had been taking a nap that afternoon i woke up and decided to go home but when i walked outside i saw my uncle standing out in the middle of the yard staring at the sky

    i asked him what is it and without saying a word he pointed to the sky above my grandmother backyard back there wa a field and a cb radio tower my grandparent are truck driver 

     so i turned and looked to see what he wa looking at and there about 500 ft above the cb tower wa an object floating in the sky 


       it wasnt a traditional saucer shape it wa a cylinder it looked like it had an armature hanging from the bottom and it had some sort of spherical shape in the center that nearly seemed to be projecting character on it from the distance i couldnt discern what it wa i looked at in disbelief for about 5 second and looked to my uncle for an explanation  then i looked back and it wa completely gone 


     i dont remember saying much to my uncle but i remember feeling a very heavy sense of dread and i sprinted home a fast a i could thinking we are not alone i wa so scared i kind of put it out of my mind and have always been afraid to really talk about it the older i got the more it felt like did i just dream that 


      a few week ago i wa back home i am 29 now and i saw my uncle we got to talking about how crazy this year ha been and it wa around the time the off planet vehicle had been mentioned in the news i asked my uncle if he remembered that day because i felt like it might have been a dream he said yeah i remember that we wa standing right out here in the yard then he pointed to where we saw it at chills


      there is more out there than what we know or can explain i feel my dream have tied me to this event too in my life but thats a different story thanks for reading i have also seen strange light in the sky here at night recently if you live in florida let me know if youve had any similar experience ",j79c3g,"  let me start by saying i live in the panhandle in florida it wa easter sunday around 1999 about 5 pm so still daylight outside and i wa about 8 year old i had went to my grandmother house next door to my house and had been taking a nap that afternoon i woke up and decided to go home but when i walked outside i saw my uncle standing out in the middle of the yard staring at the sky

"hi so here a bit of a long story basically throughout my life i 19 had some weird and unexplainable thing happen im half skepticalhalf believer in all of them though ill do it in a timeline from when i a baby to now    this is something i recently found out about from my mom or she told me and i forgot i wa only around two at the time and my mom wa outside on the porch on the phone with someone while she wa chatting a bright white orb appeared out of nowhere flew directly in her face and flew off disappearing it wa about the size of a soccer ball maybe a bit bigger it wa really bright fast and wa able to fade away she thought it wa a ghost of someone that died recently at the time but thats a whole other can of worm than alien lol this whole experience could also be just a hallucination from grief maybe  


   i wa a bit older i always had a reoccurring dream of a green figure with a big head  appearing from the foot of my parent bed i slept with my parent when i wa little  grabbing me by the heel and dragging me down and then i woke up a side note ill add is that id scream for my parent abut they wouldnt wake up which wa always an odd detail that occurred a well alien believer side say it an abduction but my logical side say it just a nightmare thats similar to one  


   one a bit weirder around the time i wa 8 i cant remember the exact detail like my exact age or date i wa going to my friend house on my bike we lived in a culdesac and every experience previous to this happened on the same street i got to the end of the street since he lived right on the end and i parked my bike on the light post and i looked to wood that end the street i looked back and about 150 foot in front of me wa what to be blunt looked like a tall and slender greenish figure like a gray alien but it had black almost angry shaped eye similar to a gray also having a purple robe it just stared at me it arm stretched out like it wanted me to come to it of course by seeing this instead of driving off on my bike i just bolted to my friend house their yard is about 130 foot so it took a few second even when i wa running at full speed so i just started pounding on the door for them to let me in and of course to my luck nobody wa home i looked back at the wood and now it wa even closer about a 100 foot away from me still staying inside the wood it wa in the same outstretched position i didnt hear it move through the leaf and it didnt look out of breath from swiftly moving through the wood that would be required to get that close to me that paired with the fact it could blink made it obvious it wasnt a costume that and the fact no one is weird enough to go to a random street in the middle of nowhere with a suit advanced enough to blink  around summer in 2009 no le for the extreeeeemely off chance they could scare one of the few kid that live on that street if they chose to go to that exact spot after seing it wa getting closer i bolted back for my bike and rode off never seeing it again someone said it wa a reptilian and i wa smart to run but idk the specific of alien type a year or so later i moved and have been moving to different house over the span of a few year leading up to this year with my final story  
 with the first orb story i learned that another orb wa spotted by my mom recently she owns a ring doorbell and usually check the archived footage whenever something wa spotted moving when she wake up in the morning it happened on september 30th early in the morning when it wa still dark she clicked on one of the video and she saw a white orb off to the side on the porch it came close to the door  and flew off before fading away honestly all these thing put together are super weird so idk what to make of it ",j6yh73,"hi so here a bit of a long story basically throughout my life i 19 had some weird and unexplainable thing happen im half skepticalhalf believer in all of them though ill do it in a timeline from when i a baby to now    this is something i recently found out about from my mom or she told me and i forgot i wa only around two at the time and my mom wa outside on the porch on the phone with someone while she wa chatting a bright white orb appeared out of nowhere flew directly in her face and flew off disappearing it wa about the size of a soccer ball maybe a bit bigger it wa really bright fast and wa able to fade away she thought it wa a ghost of someone that died recently at the time but thats a whole other can of worm than alien lol this whole experience could also be just a hallucination from grief maybe

i wa just thinking what if the alien are another form of lifeform maybe silicon or perhaps if their galaxy or star system ha another substance similar to carbon could possibly explain the constant sighting maybe they found u a carbon based lifeform and were mind blown perhaps carbon lifeforms arent very common we dont know otherwise could explain them visiting a perhaps they are trying to work out how we work just like if we found let say a silicon based lifeform no evidence to suggest this just a shower thought ,j6qpdk,i wa just thinking what if the alien are another form of lifeform maybe silicon or perhaps if their galaxy or star system ha another substance similar to carbon could possibly explain the constant sighting maybe they found u a carbon based lifeform and were mind blown perhaps carbon lifeforms arent very common we dont know otherwise could explain them visiting a perhaps they are trying to work out how we work just like if we found let say a silicon based lifeform no evidence to suggest this just a shower thought ,0

hope someone can help me to elaborate or make correction on this idea objective of the gray is to compile a library of genetic material in order  to obtain all type of biochemical substance from all

it mentally the fiscal abduction are to obtain genetic information of the subject and the other one is to obtain mental information for the subject there is the same they cant tell the difference on the mental abduction the gray put the subject to stressful situation pain pleasure mental task stress and all kind of situation in order to create a mental map of the creature they are investigating   the mental information they have collected now they are able to put thought in any individual and make that individual think those are their own they are able to control emotion feeling and body motion gray have develop a way to manufacture material almost at the atomic level with this technology they have created very thin and resistant material and also magnet that can contrarest gravity there are also some electromagnet for stabilization and increase of the flotation effect this is use a a suspension system on their craft the propulsion system is a ion particle canyon this is for the craft used inside an atmosphere there are 3 different type or classification of craft interstellar interplanetary and the classic  flying saucer each one may be capable of overlapping another one

a source of energy they use uranium from there they go to different type of isotope depending of what they are going to do some how they have manage to control the reactor using almost all the energy of the isotope and converting all the radioactive energy  into kinetic energy basically what they do is they pas the energy from the radioactive isotope to a non radioactive material they overload it with energy then it go expelled by one side of the craft at high speed and this move the craft to the other side the quantity of mass expelled is very small but the quantity of energy is very high   chamber that contains the radioactive material do tree thing it reduces the radioactive reaction by absorbing the neutron when is needed it increase the radioactive reaction by reflecting the neutron  when is needed and conduct the neutron to at high speed the fuel that is going to be expelled the fuel  i thing can be anything but there are some material that are le corrosive to the engine then others like novel gas   bottom part of the craft have the shape of a bowl so it act the same a when you put a bowl on the water it float but in a magnetic field spread in all direction   inside is almost empty at the center in a column is the reactor propulsion system and generator at the bottom in thin lair is the suspension system at the ceiling they can put what ever devise they are going to use and all around the central column is the usable space which must of the time is separated in section the control panel have just a few button and a brain interface the front wall is like a huge screen and you can see trough the floor   the interstellar travel they create very large type of explosive the core is a very heavy element a huge carbon sphere is made to contain the explosive and the heavy element then is detonated but because there is no way out it compress it self creating a temporary black hole that pool the craft at very high speed passing trough close the event horizon then to brake down they do the same process in the opposite direction this is why this craft cant get into a solar system it will disrupt planet and other body  orbit once they arrive to a solar system they never go have a system of telecommunication  that i did not understood completely in the way it work i think it have something to do with quantum mechanic this type of communication mix machine information brain tough and dream in a very organized and controlled way also is faster then light is instantaneous and  personal name are unnecessary  well you can also u a name but is really redundant you can use a felling a fiscal feature a smell or anything to sell a message to a person or to a machine and they have access directly trough their brain and we kind of have access too we are not excluded but is kind of hard to use because is not made for u we will only see part of the picture i guess this is why people say i just got the idea from nowhere  by the way they do have

come out in full size but it is still a child male and queen are le common like the ant they mostly live underground they still have some vestigial smell communication   they it is when they are larva mostly plant when they grow they eat protein and some kind of honey they made with a fruit and some enzyme they can not eat all the protein from earth but they can turn them into aminoacids and then they can eat it    difference they have with human are just the reproductive system their mental ability digestive system which is very simple and they need to process all the food before they eat it

i saved this comment year ago before i found this sub enjoy this wall of text that i annoy skeptic with  believe that these extraterrestrial vehicle and their crew are visiting this planet from other planet which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on earth colonel gordon cooper mercury  gemini astronaut happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the ufo phenomenon is real it ha been covered up by government for quite some time now captain edgar mitchell apollo 14 astronaut been asked about ufo and ive said publicly i thought they ufo were somebody else some other civilization astronaut eugene cernan apollo 17 commander wa testing a p51 fighter in minneapolis when i spotted this object  it looked like a

this dream wa easily the strangest dream ive ever had in late 2018 i fell asleep on the floor of my bedroom and while i wa asleep i dreamt that i wa on the floor of my bedroom with a grey alien standing over me  grey didnt communicate anything to me all he did wa wiggle his arm around in the air like a lunatic the grey stuck his arm up above his head and wiggled them then i woke up woke up feeling nervous and some of the furniture in my room wa moved around i interpret that to be evidence of sleep walking because i have a history of sleepwalking and doing stuff in my sleep  let me emphasize that some furniture wa moved when i woke up in my dream the alien stood  behind my set of drawer when i woke up the set of drawer had moved and all of my belonging had been knocked to the ground it would be easier to explain the dream if i could draw you a picture but it completely true to say that i dreamt of an alien moving furniture in my bedroom and when i woke up the furniture had indeed been moved saw a grey in my dream of course it wa just a dream but it wa a very strange dream ,j646s3,this dream wa easily the strangest dream ive ever had in late 2018 i fell asleep on the floor of my bedroom and while i wa asleep i dreamt that i wa on the floor of my bedroom with a grey alien standing over me  grey didnt communicate anything to me all he did wa wiggle his arm around in the air like a lunatic the grey stuck his arm up above his head and wiggled them then i woke up woke up feeling nervous and some of the furniture in my room wa moved around i interpret that to be evidence of sleep walking because i have a history of sleepwalking and doing stuff in my sleep  let me emphasize that some furniture wa moved when i woke up in my dream the alien stood  behind my set of drawer when i woke up the set of drawer had moved and all of my belonging had been knocked to the ground it would be easier to explain the dream if i could draw you a picture but it completely true to say that i dreamt of an alien moving furniture in my bedroom and when i woke up the furniture had indeed been moved saw a grey in my dream of course it wa just a dream but it wa a very strange dream ,0
i know this isnt currently possible but let assume this is sometime in the not too distant future let also assume we have the technology for interstellar travel so we know we have to evacuate earth for whatever reason and weve got the technology but this is far a weve gotten an example challenge could be the engineering problem what kind of vessel will we need well assume the population remains around 7 billion i hadnt really thought of the time frame but ill say we have 200 year another example challenge could be how we ensure our new home planet is actually suitable wouldnt want to move to a planet thats quickly becoming unhabitable one final example what about the life on that planet it may look like paradise but maybe we can also see predator we dont know enough about roaming the land literally anything you can think of will probably be valid and relevant something different i guess feel free to implement plausible advancement to help with the mission not thing like instant teleportation let assume well have a fair number of potential planet but due to our limited time frame there only enough time for a small number of visit to make sure it actually habitable and reasonably safe etc we dont have enough time for a full in depth understanding of the life on all these planet to the point where wed understand them the way we understand animal on this planet if the new planet is already inhabited by alien so be it we also need to survive ,j63sb4,i know this isnt currently possible but let assume this is sometime in the not too distant future let also assume we have the technology for interstellar travel so we know we have to evacuate earth for whatever reason and weve got the technology but this is far a weve gotten an example challenge could be the engineering problem what kind of vessel will we need well assume the population remains around 7 billion i hadnt really thought of the time frame but ill say we have 200 year another example challenge could be how we ensure our new home planet is actually suitable wouldnt want to move to a planet thats quickly becoming unhabitable one final example what about the life on that planet it may look like paradise but maybe we can also see predator we dont know enough about roaming the land literally anything you can think of will probably be valid and relevant something different i guess feel free to implement plausible advancement to help with the mission not thing like instant teleportation let assume well have a fair number of potential planet but due to our limited time frame there only enough time for a small number of visit to make sure it actually habitable and reasonably safe etc we dont have enough time for a full in depth understanding of the life on all these planet to the point where wed understand them the way we understand animal on this planet if the new planet is already inhabited by alien so be it we also need to survive ,0
what if the energy they use to travel to earth is too valuable to be spent on common resource that can be found anywhere else in the universe or use any effort at all whether theyre from another far away galaxy human from the future another universe etc only reason the we get any activity at all is probably just to check u out for educational purpose example we a human wouldnt invade a planet of insect when they are inferior specie and better resource to collect from other planet comet or any celestial body irregardless whether they contain life  probably only send someone to collect a living sample of the insect and learn from it and or experiment on a few no need to send the whole human race to collect a few a human and just a alien have no reason to spend the precious energy to kill them or invade them when life is probably common to find with more advanced technology and bigger better resource to collect in place other than earth or other planet alike advanced specie would get little to no gain from invading for a relatively small rock of common resource like earth unless you know we had an ultra rare infinity stone in possession ,j62ir3,what if the energy they use to travel to earth is too valuable to be spent on common resource that can be found anywhere else in the universe or use any effort at all whether theyre from another far away galaxy human from the future another universe etc only reason the we get any activity at all is probably just to check u out for educational purpose example we a human wouldnt invade a planet of insect when they are inferior specie and better resource to collect from other planet comet or any celestial body irregardless whether they contain life  probably only send someone to collect a living sample of the insect and learn from it and or experiment on a few no need to send the whole human race to collect a few a human and just a alien have no reason to spend the precious energy to kill them or invade them when life is probably common to find with more advanced technology and bigger better resource to collect in place other than earth or other planet alike advanced specie would get little to no gain from invading for a relatively small rock of common resource like earth unless you know we had an ultra rare infinity stone in possession ,0
i wa thinkingif you had a specie that had run amok on a planet to the detriment of all other specie and even the planet’s environment atmosphere and ecosystem then an efficient way to control that specie would be a selective biological control like a virus for instance not one that worked too quickly that would be messy with carcass rotting everywhere one that worked relatively slowly say over a few year so any carcass could be tidied up by the dwindling surviving population just a thought ,j60tpk,i wa thinkingif you had a specie that had run amok on a planet to the detriment of all other specie and even the planet’s environment atmosphere and ecosystem then an efficient way to control that specie would be a selective biological control like a virus for instance not one that worked too quickly that would be messy with carcass rotting everywhere one that worked relatively slowly say over a few year so any carcass could be tidied up by the dwindling surviving population just a thought ,0

okay so alien show up tomorrow turn out the government really didn’t know about it and are shocked turn out the alien are cool they want to meet u and see the planet they will give u some help with medical advance for being able to visit earth for a little bit and experience our culture they don’t really want or need anything from u but are still interested in another intelligent specie do you think life a whole will change how do you think your life personally would change is there anything you would want to do or to do differently ,j5626y,okay so alien show up tomorrow turn out the government really didn’t know about it and are shocked turn out the alien are cool they want to meet u and see the planet they will give u some help with medical advance for being able to visit earth for a little bit and experience our culture they don’t really want or need anything from u but are still interested in another intelligent specie do you think life a whole will change how do you think your life personally would change is there anything you would want to do or to do differently ,0

going through the 11th density first matrix allow for the widest range of experience within our universe and probably influence each other in subtle way allowing each version of the universe to be very rich and full of all manner of experience like a song can be filled with all type of melody what are grid are the energetic mechanism of collective consciousness network they are like the internet of the galaxy beaming geometric vibration through space and time these energy web connect everything to everything and create oneness where division seems to exist are not bound by time so they can transmit information a condensed energy to and from the future and past this work through entangles particle and energy all traveling through the core of a torus shape and maintaining this entanglement throughout all of timespace can measure grid in the electromagnetic spectrum though we would only be picking up on the tip of the iceberg a most of the energy is too high vibrational to interact directly with our physical matter this higher energy is a geometric communication medium we will discus shortly see video in playlist

i know that ufo are a real phenomenon and that the u government is hiding information on ufo from the public i am skeptical of the idea that ets have interacted with human however i am fascinated by the story on this sub for those people who believe alien have made contact why do you think the government want to hide this wouldnt it make more sense for ufo to be related to some kind of secret technology or military purpose in which case it would make sense to hide it   not trying to argue or antagonize any believer i just cant stop wondering about this ,j3lo4b,i know that ufo are a real phenomenon and that the u government is hiding information on ufo from the public i am skeptical of the idea that ets have interacted with human however i am fascinated by the story on this sub for those people who believe alien have made contact why do you think the government want to hide this wouldnt it make more sense for ufo to be related to some kind of secret technology or military purpose in which case it would make sense to hide it   not trying to argue or antagonize any believer i just cant stop wondering about this ,0

" had a training experience with golden triangle head being last night well it a copy paste so 23 day or more ago   on fb told me to tell them to remember everything upon waking up and i sure did holy crap  


 they are golden skin triangle head alien of 3 foot tall in soul form   
 they wore golden robe they had a golden aura full f kindness and gentleness it something so special it very hard to describe    connected to the love of the universe  
 they are immensely benevolent they never disrespect you treat you with kindness and make you understand a lot of thing   that people had thing to learn in theirs life and you cant interrupt people making mistake they have to learn from  
 i wa wa in a tall transparent crystal tower with spiral stair and there were room where people were trained   tall golden teacher there were 3 of them they are very tall double or triple our height wore golden robe were of pure soul energy and looked at screen and stuff   showed me the aura of evil and it wa the most suffocating thing i have ever experienced basically the evil of the iluminati and stuff   never called for help so fast in my life it wa suffocating i felt like i wa torn apart and losing my mind   just like that i didnt feel it anymore like i wa a golden bubble  
 theirs eye were multicolor like the rainbow and they exuded a very strong aura of love   to ask to remember everything when you wake up respectfully and gently   youre being trained too   constantly have memory of dream of having power and using them and using technology hyper advanced like thing write themselves if you cast your handthoughts on it flying it very hard making orb in my hand creating fire transforming to animal being animal ect   kind of  tiring thought   only 1 hour of your sleep that hey train you    power i get in dream   
 i can create  swirling ball in my hand make fire make sphere of lovehealing same shit everyone is dressed in blue uniform in a translucent crystal tower with spiral stair the tower have multiple room where people train theirs power each floor ha a different mastery level  everyone there are a soul everyone ha their body asleep we can communicate with thought  aura   


  
 were all invited a a soul   call it dream training    will all going to see them when the earth will go to 5d in our dream probably   really nice a soul they have golden robe golden energy  aura and have multicolor eye   speak in their aurastelepathic they face you and send theirs thought to you the tech they use is telepathic think and it writes    5d thing is the great awakening q post  q the great awakening map sheduled to happen soon   this year or next year   very hard to understand what these guy think a soon and a few monthsmoments while they told me they can live up to 10 000 year in their soul form they have transcended the need for body   kid are on their planet at home being schooled for a long long time to be great people compassionate loving and balanced person   go past adolescence and adulthood and are deemed good enough a person they then start their journey of teaching other lifeforms to be better people use power and ect

  
 you think youre being trained by them feeling of constantly using no earth tech earth tech being super cumbersome ex you feel  you use tech that thing write themsleves instead of having to type every word feeling of using power and stuff maybe youre being trained too and before you sleep remember to ask to remember everything once you wake up   
 nothing get remembered for 23 day it okay you were just not chosen your turn will happen eventually alien of all race will come to earth no question about it   will get to meet them and learn from them  
 a lot of people who are being trained every night they all wear blue uniform  have different mastery level and time they come in  
 the power we use each floor ha it own room with it focus  
 each floor    feel the energy  meditation simple sensing   exit it and shape it     create fire swirling ball water ect    
  use the energy a body extension like extra arm wing tentacle to get a hold of stuff and grab stuff far away even use the energy a purifying bead    
  actually heal very hard im not even close to that yet it extremely dangerous if done improperly  we use tech that interface with the soul   
 way we can use the power is 100 the same a the taichi avatar last airbender thing and doctor strange astral thing   thing can be found in ancient art and way of living tai chi fuon gong ect they are the best gateway learning process 

   tech we use there   a translucent screen that you put your hand on it and your idea is drawing from your mind   better flat screen stuff holographic watch that ha a clock but with shitload of rotating menu and other meter of stuff energy solar energy tiredness negativity purity ect   a regular watch until you touch the screen on it and the screen image go up and expand to other menu and circular meter this   
 almost the same it scary and crazy healing room for soul with womb like translucent pouch where you can    in it basically sleep for the soul thing or crystal tower itself that let our power manifest there only   not in the 3d reality  
 the q map if anyone interested

my view for the past few year after reading forteans like john keel ha been that ufo are basically laser pointer for human playing with my cat using a laser pointer is pretty fun because the cat always chase the laser but never is able to catch it it like a hologram most ufo case feel this way they leave behind little physical evidence and if they do it usually just a scrap of metal this idea is similar to vallee and the control system but with a playful bent if not maybe a little malicious you can use a laser to lure a cat into a trap or just for fun but youre still deceiving it a it chase around a phantom thats why it important to study the experience first because when you chase the ufo youre chasing something not quite real and that can seemingly disappear at will if we study the experience we can find out where the origin of the ufo is from and find the laser pointer ,j3adx4,my view for the past few year after reading forteans like john keel ha been that ufo are basically laser pointer for human playing with my cat using a laser pointer is pretty fun because the cat always chase the laser but never is able to catch it it like a hologram most ufo case feel this way they leave behind little physical evidence and if they do it usually just a scrap of metal this idea is similar to vallee and the control system but with a playful bent if not maybe a little malicious you can use a laser to lure a cat into a trap or just for fun but youre still deceiving it a it chase around a phantom thats why it important to study the experience first because when you chase the ufo youre chasing something not quite real and that can seemingly disappear at will if we study the experience we can find out where the origin of the ufo is from and find the laser pointer ,0

other than david icke who else “out there” float reptilian conspiracy this is such a fascinating  frightening theory that they’re involved in government throughout the world  heard it stem from an old scifi writer from 100 year ago but can’t find the original source people have claimed to see gray and other alien but reptilian seems le common thought ,j1kv5j,other than david icke who else “out there” float reptilian conspiracy this is such a fascinating  frightening theory that they’re involved in government throughout the world  heard it stem from an old scifi writer from 100 year ago but can’t find the original source people have claimed to see gray and other alien but reptilian seems le common thought ,0
hello reddit community this is my first post on here because ive never really had much to say but i wanted to see if someone ha had a similar experience to what ha happened to me little background im a college student in tucson az and i study chemistry having a science background i can be skeptical about a lot of thing feeling like i need proof or to see thing with my own eye to believe something to what happened i wa in my car looking at thing on my phone when i must have dozed off in my driver seat at around 2am the next thing i remember is a very bright white light coming at me from the driver side window i cannot stress how bright it wa i looked at it and immediately couldnt see anything besides the light i closed my eye and could still see the brightness in my eye lid a if i were looking at the sun with closed eye a my eye were closed i could feel myself have a seizure now im type 1 diabetic and have had seizure before but ive never been conscious of it ive only had seizure with extremely low blood sugar and it wasnt low at all it wa perfectly fine not to mention it been like 10 year since ive had one this is what make me think they were convulsion and not a seizure so with my eye closed i could feel myself violently shake it felt so weird all i know is i wanted to keep my eye closed because if this wa happening with my eye closed what would happen if i opened my eye i dont know how long this went on but it felt pretty brief when it wa over and the light disappeared i kept my eye closed i wa fully awake with my eye closed and i just sat there thinking i wa super terrified and i felt very vulnerablei wanted so bad to open my eye but wa too afraid of the consequence if i did i did the thing where you pretend you are asleep because you dont want to deal with the reality thats going on outside your eye i kept my eye closed for a couple minute until i got the courage to peek out my left eye and didnt see anything out of the ordinary i checked the top of my phone and it wa 245am so not much time at all had elapsed i wanted to go outside my car and check thing out but i just found myself too scared to even move i felt there wa nothing i could do anyway so after that i just kept looking out the window and didnt see anything until about 10 minute later straight out my driver side window and a little to the left and maybe a half mile away i saw something rise in to the sky it wa very dark but i could not see through it so i know it had substance it looked like the shadow of a tall bipedal humanoid looking thing and it shot into the sky very fast slow enough to where i could see it but fast enough for me to know it not man made maybe about a fast a a ball would go if you kicked it up but it had no propulsion that i could see it sound pretty unbelievable now that im rereading this but im just explaining what i saw i have no idea what happened it baffle me i dont want to make claim about what it wa because i have no idea i dont have any evidence besides what happened to me and what i saw and felt it could have been a dream but im pretty sure it wasnt i know for a fact ive never confused a dream for real life before ever it pretty obvious whats a dream and whats real life you dont feel pain in a dream for one thing and thats something i felt from the light the whole time i experienced the light and the convulsion i wa conscious and thinking and holding my eye tight another thing thats strange is the air around me in my car felt really weird everything felt charged like i could feel my hair standing up this wa nothing id ever experienced before so it tough to compare it to something i trust my perception and feeling ive never had sleep paralysis before and i dont use drug or smoke weed anymore i quit weed 2 year ago for school so i know what i saw however i am open to different theory and interpretation either for or against mine if someone ha had something similar happen to them or who know what could have happened to me then please let me know ,j1jiga,hello reddit community this is my first post on here because ive never really had much to say but i wanted to see if someone ha had a similar experience to what

"when i wa about 13 or 14 year old my friend juan adrian and i used to go squid fishing in the summer at the port of my town it is a fishing town in northern galicia with no more than 2000 inhabitant night we had gone to the beach we had no choice and i am still cursing that decision there were many people fishing in the port and we did not want to bundle our line with those of other fisherman since we were with some friend from madrid david and marco who came on vacation and didnt know how to fish wa a full moon it wa not so dark to be 11 or 12 at night i remember the reflection in the sea sat in our folding chair and started fishing we spent a while telling story and laughing having a good time a while we concentrated on what we were doing since we had not caught anything and we entered into a deep silence only the sea and the reed gathering their line could be heard pointed with his finger towards the top of the cliff that is next to the beach about 200 meter from where we were and said that rock give the impression that it is going to fall
 friend adrián immediately said i dont think ive ever seen her before
 also said that he believed that there wa not a stone so big it would be about 5 or 10 meter that i said i wa not sure
 were all attentive while adrian said that this wa not a stone that shone differently from other rock and that it had a very soft shape it wa shaped like a flattened egg or like a raindrop but more rounded were watching all night but nothing happened the truth is that the stone had a shape that if an adult saw it he would surely panic and go home the next day they would not believe him period today i still remember that shape and where it wa located on that cliff and im scared to death a child we are still there watching her each went home wondering what that stone wa and why it had that shape and why it shone like that after i got home i received a message from adrian on the mobile phone telling me that from his house you can see the cliff and that he is looking with the binoculars and that he doe not see the stone that he go down to look live next to the beach there wasnt even 15 minute before i got home my parent had woken up and i couldnt get off i had to wait they fell asleep i left my room like a ninja and left the house without making the slightest noise it wa more or le 2 in the morning reaching the beach and looking at the cliff the stone wa missing a strong heartbeat make me shiver with fear and i go straight home arrival i write to adrian to tell him that i just went to the beach and he tell me that he also told juan so that he could check it out next day my mother woke me up with the news that juan had disappeared all night but that he wa found at dawn in the center of town cry very sweaty and staring whole town wa puzzled juans mother had spent the worst night of his life while juan did not remember anything of what had happened he only remembers walking around town until someone saw him and called his parent and the authority mother during that time were very scared thinking that there wa some type of rapist or psychopath who kidnapped child and prohibited u from playing in place where there were no more people much le going fishing wa given medical test of all kind physical and psychological and apparently juan show a serious trauma to something that he doe not know how to explain he doe not remember what happened he only remembers a feeling that is what scare him this wa told by juans mother to my mother she did not give her many more detail either did not see juan again until he started the school year and he wa never the same a before he wa very inactive submissive he wa always alone and did not want to talk to anyone had always been a very sociable boy like everyone else he wa our friend and after the incident he stopped talking to everyone and kept away from people 12 year have passed and we do not know anything about juan shortly after the incident he and his parent moved to another place because it wa said that juan had outbreak of anxiety here and i never talked to anyone about it because nothing made sense at the time police the day after the event when juan appeared checked the message on his cell phone and saw that adrian had sent him an envelope at 2 in the morning telling him to go to the beach to check the stone which he thought wa no longer i wa police gathered the boy together and asked u nonsensical question like if we played a joke on juan or if we had gotten involved with other older boy to tie him to a tree our mad the re corroborated that we were at home and that obviously we were not going to do anything like that to a friend of ours who had been like brother at that time and i year after the event came to the conclusion that it wa a ufo we have seen photo of ufo taken by other people in other place practically identical to the one we saw and that that night juan wa abducted today nobody know anything about juan and his family that moment on i have followed the ufo phenomenon and the subject of abduction and everything i have seen except 4 or 6 ufo video is all false those people talking with that face of having slept well with that exactitude when recounting the fact that way of expressing themselves a if what had happened to them wa normal  they dont tell the truth think i can confirm 100 that i have seen a friend before and after being abducted and that change your life for the worse you go crazy because of what you see you do not consciously remember what happened but your subconscious yes always and thats where the trauma come from the expression on your face change you become more submissive and insecure  it a bunch of negative thing you are no longer the same person do not usually tell this story and if i do it is under a nick on the internet for not having translated this story into english but im on my phone and there is a character limit in the translator is good therapy to tell this even if no one read it tomorrow if i have

first thing first i have an unshakable belief beyond wishful or religious in the existence of alien life in the form of intelligent being this belief wa refined over the year with the study of the phenomenon the book my inclination to ancient history that brought me to the not so refined work of von daniken but which in turn led me to zacharia sitchin and many others this is not a recent phenomenon my phobia nightmare fuel and simultaneous fascination with aliensufo ha been there since my very first memory i have a constant feeling that i do not remember something and if i do recall it i am not completely certain that these are fabricated memory from dream or my young imagination following are some of the earliest memory i have between age 6 and 1213 in italy very first recurring nightmare wa of having a picnic with my parent in a green grass park next to tree when suddenly 4 to 5 tall men in grey suit at the time i associated them to the enemy of the power ranger putty patroller please check for image on google would grab me and take me away recurring dream especially when i had a fever wa of runningdrivingflying uncontrollably fast in specific one of being on someone shoulder while he ran reaching absurd speed can not be one 100 sure but i have crosschecked this next point with my mother who seems to remember something of the sort i remember waking up with 9 round brownish burned looking mark on the stomach this memory came flooding back after watching a documentary on the falcon lake incident and seeing similar mark on one of the abductees my childhood i have been sick on a regular basis almost monthly with very high and sudden fever in this age range i have vague memory of symbol scratched onto my window but i still dismiss them today a just dirt an obsession with spotting satellite and a lasting fear of the dark to this day i find it difficult to fall asleep unless some movie or show is playing on my laptop following is from age 1314 to 1920 i am 31 year old france where i have lived for about 10 year we have a large enough property with a modern chalet style house in the middle of a large garden surrounded by tree at night from the very beginning i could hear heavy step running around the house from my ground floor bedroom the step would get fainter a they went around and louder a they approached closer to my room the time the step took to run around the house in circle wa too fast weirdly fast something worth mentioning is the stomping wa clearly of two distinct footstep and not of an animal running on all four this happened every night throughout the 810 year i have lived there with my mom this time i can not recall if it wa while the running sound wa happening our garden developed a fairy ring quite large in diameter between 34m i have read about them and even if the name implies something fairy related the explanation is of a fungus colony that take the ring like shape nonetheless given all of the above i thought it worth of mention one of the summer spent in italy when i wa small i have witnessed something i still can not explain and i wa not alone while with a friend at his grandparent house playing in the back yard we could see the lit light of the 3 story house in front of his in particular one window wa lit in yellow light with the horizontal shade open and the outline of a man with both his hand up on the glass and his finger moving a if playing with the shade i turned to look at my friend who in turn looked at me freaked out we both turned our head towards the window and the same shadowy outline with it hand up on the window and it finger playing with the shade no longer had it head it wa headless and still moving we ran away immediately terrified i have spoken to him about it 2 month ago the same bedroom mentioned earlier one night while fully awake and conscious something quite silly but terrifying took place i wa trying my best to fall asleep a i had school the next morning and one voice a loud a hear my finger typing now said in my ear youre a penguin i do not claim a connection with anything and i do not know if the voice in my head or rather in my ear said something that sounded like that or if in fact perhaps i am a penguin i did not sleep that night and i now wonder what my brain interpreted that voice to be saying something worth mentioning is after telling the story to my father he said that shortly before he woke up from a voice shouting in his year 67 again do not know that it mean if it mean anything or if you heard of similar account have what i believe to be a small cyst in my arm i can feel it and hold it between my finger it feel mobile i do not doubt that it is exactly that a cyst that i should probably get it removed but in the spirit of full disclosure i have thought on multiple occasion what if it isnt i am 31 i have an incredible girlfriend who belief me and a family who doesnt disbelieve me i am passionate and studious in the phenomenon i have the book and they taught me about history the manuscript of jung who in it part taught me about philosophy and psychoanalysis i have the military document from more trustworthy source greer and others and le so tom delonge in any case the strangeness quieted down since i moved to the middle east in 2015 but it hasnt stopped and my interest is boiling inside me more than ever just writing all of it down for the first time clarifies and sharpens memory and i am sure i missed a few i am studying the region for historical feature which could be connected to the phenomenon and i have found rock carving in oman clearly depicting grey within human recently my mother found a very strange foot of what we guess could be an animal in the same garden in the house in france the skin is white and bloodless the texture is chicken like but the size is too big and wide to be an avian week the light in my apartment in dubai turned on in the middle of the night while with my girlfriend driving a low light orb wa on top of my car and a i wa looking at it it suddenly shot forward disappearing at the horizon move to the middle east ha brought a lot of positive energy a if lifted from something i have started to go to the gym very regularly my mind feel sharp i am eating well and am driven on my career i have a fantastic relationship with my girlfriend and i feel good enough to share the above weirdness is all i can remember so far but i do hope to hear your kind feedback ,iywqra,first thing first i have an unshakable belief beyond wishful or religious in the

"many of you may have noticed an increase of sighting video over the last several month that show dozen of shimmering light in the sky sometimes during the day but also at night a lot of these have been dismissed a skylink launch lantern bird etc but i am not personally convinced any of those are an adequate explanation to what we are seeing 
 addition to these poor explanation we have a couple instance of a more cryptic answer in at least two of these sighting thread a user ha responded with the title project sigmund and nothing more when probed for elaboration they are unable to provide any 
    
     two user i have found that posted something about project sigmund are the following
  this person ha also posted tremendous amount of other claim yet wa unwilling to elaborate on project sigmund i have compiled a list of all the recent sighting i have been able to find the one marked with an x are the one i am le convinced are project sigmund but still potentials

 location date maybe uk 9142020  branson missouri 9152020  izmir turkey 9142020 upload date  lille northern france 9132020  los angeles california 8262020  houston texas houston texas x chile 6182020  ohio 5252020 x mexico 1282005  los angeles california 7282020  los angeles california 7292020  poland 9132020    x  8162020 x hamlet indiana 9212020 
 conclusion i have no idea what this is but my hope is by that compiling this list just maybe we can get a better picture of what this could be or someone with more information might see this and be willing to divulge i would also like it if we could continue adding new sighting to this list or any old sighting i have missed comment concern ",iy7p9e,"many of you may have noticed an increase of sighting video over the last several month that show dozen of shimmering light in the sky sometimes during the day but also at night a lot of these have been dismissed a skylink launch lantern bird etc but i am not personally convinced any of those are an adequate explanation to what we are seeing

     two user i have found that posted something about project sigmund are the following
  this person ha also posted tremendous amount of other claim yet wa unwilling to elaborate on project sigmund i have compiled a list of all the recent sighting i have been able to find the one marked with an x are the one i am le convinced are project sigmund but still potentials

a group of italian in the 50 make friend with a group of alien who they call the w56 friend the story seems outlandish absurd and honestly stupid this coincides with jacque vallees theory of the absurdity of encounter benchmark and control mechanism  we cant comprehend their end goal for u a a civilization they are not studying u they know more about u than we a human know about ourselves according to the video and writing we are being guided into their philosophy and overall culture  which ha been pretty hard for them their culture mirror heavily on jesus teaching basically love one another and take care of each other but not just a a community but in every aspect of human endeavor for example technology is very important for them and their moral determine their technology it not just a mean to reach an end to ufo their craft are not just tech but a manifestation of their moral code  like if it were their temple this is one of the reason why they show them off and permit people to see them to show what they have achieved with a morally based tech their craft are programmed to cause no harm although there are others who have other intention another tech shown is extremely ecology friendly for example their base can retract and all the surroundings return a it wa before their belief seem so outlandish to u that all interaction with them seem absurd  from a human perspective they have a set of control mechanism that are set that way for interacting with u because of how human are no idea why commented about the book chain of sea a book where alien are in contact with a sentient ai created by human but in the case of w56 the sentient ai is not from earth and they are here to cause harm and conflict according to them the ai started just a a human civilization that took a wrong turn in the advancement of their technology and the ai nourishes from conflict for some reason grey an encounter that occurred in mexico where a person say he had made friend with alien and he also call them my friend the whole premise of this interaction is quite identical to the italian one and equally absurd then there another encounter in brazil where the ufo where very artisanal in nature and the alien gave off an extremely hippie vibe their tech and moral coincided with the italian w56 they are not just extraterrestrial they are also from other dimension and some italian from the w56 considered them more human than human they had more humanness which might coincide with lous comment on there being more than one human race will add that due to their philosophy it might explain the hippie vibe at the end of unidentified the show will go a for to speculate that cmdr fravor wa chosen to witness the ufo do to his moral and life experience makeup

if alien came we would be enslaved like european did to indigenous people   would be like colombus   would be harvested    are very common misconception ive seen repeated in movie and even by scientist but this is not only a flawed logic but also a misunderstanding of history   start with the latter why did we really end slavery   it or not it not because we were compassionate towards the slave the real reason is because slavery is economically inefficient    start with the slaver owner perspective a a slave owner you have to buy your slave and if they die or flee the next day your money went to the garbage so you have to take care of them feed them and but you also have to make sure they work and theyre not gonna work a hard a they can or smart theyre no incentive besides survival and even then your profit is not guaranteed   that to a business owner he just ha to pay le than his profit and if anything happens to his employee he can just hire someone else   what about society most of the time with slavery you have a stagnant society because the market is more limited there le incentive for enterpreneuring or improving anything le competition it just a garbage system overall why would a specie with a much bigger intelect and superior technology have such system   here the real flawed logic what would they gain from enslaving u in the first place if they have the technology to travel light year and keep coming to earth without people noticing what could we possibly offer to a type 23 civilization    they could clone any specie and eat a much a they want   they could terraform any exoplanet    they can have robot or ai human are already worried about ai taking all the job can you imagine alien    nothing we can offer them but this knowledge about our specie    we would be like indigenous people is incredibly arrogant indigenous people just didnt have the knowledge we are more like the dumbest primate ,iwfots,if alien came we would be enslaved like european did to indigenous people   would be like colombus   would be harvested    are very common misconception ive seen repeated in movie and even by scientist but this is not only a flawed logic but also a misunderstanding of history   start with the latter why did we really end slavery   it or not it not because we were compassionate towards the slave the real reason is because slavery is economically inefficient    start with the slaver owner perspective a a slave owner you have to buy your slave and if they die or flee the next day your money went to the garbage so you have to take care of them feed them and but you also have to make sure they work and theyre not gonna work a hard a they can or smart theyre no incentive besides survival and even then your profit is not guaranteed   that to a business owner he just ha to pay le than his profit and if anything happens to his employee he can just hire someone else   what about society most of the time with slavery you have a stagnant society because the market is more limited there le incentive for enterpreneuring or improving anything le competition it just a garbage system overall why would a specie with a much bigger intelect and superior technology have such system   here the real flawed logic what would they gain from enslaving u in the first place if they have the technology to travel light year and keep coming to earth without people noticing what could we possibly offer to a type 23 civilization    they could clone any specie and eat a much a they want   they could terraform any exoplanet    they can have robot or ai human are already worried about ai taking all the job can you imagine alien    nothing we can offer them but this knowledge about our specie    we would be like indigenous people is incredibly arrogant indigenous people just didnt have the knowledge we are more like the dumbest primate ,0

hi everyone im taking a weekend trip to the san luis valley and i started my journey near the sand dune i went during the day to a couple of place that were supposed to be good for seeing ufo but didnt see any during the day  returned in the night parked at the zapata fall entrance and wa just watching the sky i thought i saw a few ufo very high up and far away a well a several shooting star but the big one happened near the end  saw a group of light very close together in a row and very low to the horizon towards the sand dune it looked like the light from one larger saucer shaped ship and it looked like it wa spinning for awhile just based in hoe the light were moving it flashed yellow and green and sometimes red i watched it stay along the horizon for awhile moving at a slow steady pace i wa standing outside of my car and then i thought i felt something crawl onto my foot so i got back into my car i thought it would be gone but after some searching i found it again got further away but still along the horizon hovering but sort of dipping up and down over the same spot going a little bit forward and backwards but mostly just staying at the same spot it wasnt gaining too much altitude and i am not entirely sure if i wa seeing it correctly or not but it definitely looked like it wa moving i watched it do this for awhile and then left at one point i saw a small red light dart near it and disappear i checked back after id driven down the road for awhile and it wa gone  unfortunately wa unable to capture a picture or video of it but it will stand out to me a one or the most compelling piece of evidence that i have witnessed to prove to myself that extraterrestrial actually exist i hope to document more compelling evidence towards my case on this trip ,iw73by,hi everyone im taking a weekend trip to the san luis valley and i started my journey near the sand dune i went during the day to a couple of place that were supposed to be good for seeing ufo but didnt see any during the day  returned in the night parked at the zapata fall entrance and wa just watching the sky i thought i saw a few ufo very high up and far away a well a several shooting star but the big one happened near the end  saw a group of light very close together in a row and very low to the horizon towards the sand dune it looked like the light from one larger saucer shaped ship and it looked like it wa spinning for awhile just based in hoe the light were moving it flashed yellow and green and sometimes red i watched it stay along the horizon for awhile moving at a slow steady pace i wa standing outside of my car and then i thought i felt something crawl onto my foot so i got back into my car i thought it would be gone but after some searching i found it again got further away but still along the horizon hovering but sort of dipping up and down over the same spot going a little bit forward and backwards but mostly just staying at the same spot it wasnt gaining too much altitude and i am not entirely sure if i wa seeing it correctly or not but it definitely looked like it wa moving i watched it do this for awhile and then left at one point i saw a small red light dart near it and disappear i checked back after id driven down the road for awhile and it wa gone  unfortunately wa unable to capture a picture or video of it but it will stand out to me a one or the most compelling piece of evidence that i have witnessed to prove to myself that extraterrestrial actually exist i hope to document more compelling evidence towards my case on this trip ,0

"  so there wa a period of my life that wa very very strange which lead up to a few recent strange event ill try to cover everything i remember in chronological order a best i can  when i wa a child we lived in a white house in a small town in a neighborhood with lot of neighbor my brother and i slept on a bunkbed and each of u slept well without any problem   mother took care of each of u a a single mom and worked hard and we lived moderately well my mother eventually got a good job with her degree and we moved into a new house that wa about 30 minute away from the old one the new house wa a tall yellow house that i will call the yellow house once we moved thing got a little weird yellow house wa located in the country and we really only had one neighbor the neighbor had a completely fenced in yard and wa a decent distance away there were field surrounding the house on every side with high hill placing the house at the bottom of a sort of bowl of hill on every side the reason i mention the terrain in detail is because there could have been an army of unicorn next to our house and no one would have ever seen it we were isolated from view at any angle from what ive gathered on the subject most abduction occur in rural area and this house wa the definition of rural wa around 9 year old when we moved to the yellow house my mom wa a religious person and at the time she had had only one experience of the paranormal it wa a ufo sighting that her and her dad had seen year ago at night she described it to me later a an array of light she wasnt into alien or paranormal thing though she wa just a normal orthodox christian type person we moved to the yellow house the first strange event that happened wa my brother seemingly sleepwalking we would fall asleep in the bunkbed upstairs and my brother would wake up the next morning downstairs on the couch or on the floor this in itself wasnt that odd sleepwalking happens a time went on i developed an intense fear of going to bed i would try to go to sleep but would for some reason be absolutely terrified that someone wa going to walk into the room this went on for about a year and got to the point where i wa sleeping outside my mom door freaking out for hour before falling asleep there wa one point where i recall laying outside her door with everyone in bed and hearing the front door open downstairs i jumped up and ran into her room panicking i learned to manage the fear and slept more easily but it wa still very difficult and i would often stay up longer than intended because i just couldnt fall asleep the fear wa very specific i just feared that someone would open the door to my room and come in that wa it  day about 4 or 5 year after we had moved to the yellow house my mom and i were watching the old netflix movie that used to come by mail we decided to make some popcorn or cooky i cant remember wich i looked out the kitchen window to the field outside and saw what looked like a flashlight shining on some blue fabric the light turned off very quickly when i saw it and i immediately felt fear i told my mom in a frantic voice i wa so terrified that she believed me and also became uneasy after a while she rationalized that i had just been staring at screen too much and just imaginedhallucinated it 

 around age 15 i started to develop an odd hallucination of colored geometry that wa very faint in the center of my vision it wa very very faint but it wa there i would look at it when falling asleep sometimes and eventually it lead me to a very strange ability if i laid down and stared at this weird anomaly for a while i would go into sleep paralysis now at night time i fucking hate sleep paralysis it scary but if i entered sleep paralysis during the day the fear wa kind of diminished and i thought that this weird state wa kind of intriguing started experimenting with sleep paralysis during the day i learned to enter it with ease and how to wake myself from it if need be i never ever did it at night because it would sometimes cause mild hallucination which i couldnt handle at night in sleep paralysis i figured out how to transition my state into a lucid dream the process would go a follows lie down enter sleep paralysis and then i would either sort of wiggle myself out of my body or just slip out of it kind of automatically the trick wa to not freak out so that i wouldnt wake myself up  first lucid dream i had wa mind blowing to me i wa in my bed around 7 o clock evening time in summer i go into paralysis and i rolled over and it felt like i had rolled out of my body suddenly i could see that i wa riding on a razor scooter down the road outside my house it looked completely real and in my head i wa thinking holy shit im in my bed right now i ended up getting off the scooter and walking into the field which looked like the real field nothing wa changed tree were in the same spot etc i wondered what i could do in this new weird realm so i thought i would try to jump a high a i could so i jumped and shot up about 30 foot  i could see the ground below me and a i hit the apex of my jump i started to fall i started falling pretty fast and it scared me that i wa going to hit the ground and suddenly i wa back in my bed i wa immensely excited about what had just happened to this day i see the geometric pattern faintly in my vision always i am not schizophrenic i have a good job and a great social life i do not have any mental disorder im not sure exactly how it work but i am certain that without the pattern i wouldnt be able to easily enter sleep paralysis and the subsequent lucid dream it is an amazing ability that i wish everyone had ive tried to teach some people the method but have had no success in doing so month or so after i learned this i wa in the front yard and a black car that looked sort of like an unmarked cop car slowed to a stop in front of the house a guy rolled down the window and took a picture with flash on of me i wa sincerely confused on what the fuck he wa doing still dont have a clue but it weird you might be wondering how the lucid dreaming thing connects with abduction well im not completely certain that it is connected but i think that it might be my mother eventually told me of her experience at the yellow house one day my brother and i were not at the house and she wa watching a netflix movie and each window of the house filled with white light and suddenly 3 hour had passed she had no recollection of the missing time and her movie had finished with her not knowing what had happened in the movie she got up and from what she told me the mirror had 4 fingered hand print on it she told me that after that day she wa so freaked out that she had to take xanax to go to sleep for a month reason i decided to make this post is because after i moved out of the yellow house i have had no weird event happen until a few week ago i came home from work one night and became ill when i walked into my house i felt very compelled to go to sleep so i did with my clothes still on the next morning i woke up feeling fine but there wa a small amount of blood on my door frame and a weird mark near my stomach  of this prof that i wa abducted but it doe point in that direction in my opinion  my mom and recent step dad moved out of the house because my step dad thought that it wa haunted  about it for the series of strange shit thats happened in my life thanks for reading take it for what you will  i wa abducted by alien who opened my third eye so i could lucid dream or im crazy idk ",iw5l3e,"  so there wa a period of my life that wa very very strange which lead up to a few recent strange event ill try to cover everything i remember in chronological order a best i can  when i wa a child we lived in a white house in a small town in a neighborhood with lot of neighbor my brother and i slept on a bunkbed and each of u slept well without any problem   mother took care of each of u a a single mom and worked hard and we lived moderately well my mother eventually got a good job with her degree and we moved into a new house that wa about 30 minute away from the old one the new house wa a tall yellow house that i will call the yellow house once we moved thing got a little weird yellow house wa located in the country and we really only had one neighbor the neighbor had a completely fenced in yard and wa a decent distance away there were field surrounding the house on every side with high hill placing the house at the bottom of a sort of bowl of hill on every side the reason i mention the terrain in detail is because there could have been an army of unicorn next to our house and no one would have ever seen it we were isolated from view at any angle from what ive gathered on the subject most abduction occur in rural area and this house wa the definition of rural wa around 9 year old when we moved to the yellow house my mom wa a religious person and at the time she had had only one experience of the paranormal it wa a ufo sighting that her and her dad had seen year ago at night she described it to me later a an array of light she wasnt into alien or paranormal thing though she wa just a normal orthodox christian type person we moved to the yellow house the first strange event that happened wa my brother seemingly sleepwalking we would fall asleep in the bunkbed upstairs and my brother would wake up the next morning downstairs on the couch or on the floor this in itself wasnt that odd sleepwalking happens a time went on i developed an intense fear of going to bed i would try to go to sleep but would for some reason be absolutely terrified that someone wa going to walk into the room this went on for about a year and got to the point where i wa sleeping outside my mom door freaking out for hour before falling asleep there wa one point where i recall laying outside her door with everyone in bed and hearing the front door open downstairs i jumped up and ran into her room panicking i learned to manage the fear and slept more easily but it wa still very difficult and i would often stay up longer than intended because i just couldnt fall asleep the fear wa very specific i just feared that someone would open the door to my room and come in that wa it  day about 4 or 5 year after we had moved to the yellow house my mom and i were watching the old netflix movie that used to come by mail we decided to make some popcorn or cooky i cant remember wich i looked out the kitchen window to the field outside and saw what looked like a flashlight shining on some blue fabric the light turned off very quickly when i saw it and i immediately felt fear i told my mom in a frantic voice i wa so terrified that she believed me and also became uneasy after a while she rationalized that i had just been staring at screen too much and just

do you believe it is possible to be followed by a certain alien for a while due to their own interpretation of our emotion called loveattraction reason i bring this up is because most alien encounter by many are just observational if there is something that would be their veraion of that emotion say the alien are too advanced to have emotion but what if they are trying to have that emotion or at the very least what if by accident thwy figured out why love or attraction is important to their progress in some way mean a genuine attraction like they like the individual but is not at all like our human version of physical attraction they would not be physically attracted to usbut maybe in other way mean if they are smart would they not find intelligence attractive  a i have heard alien are very sexual   if they maybe long for something beyond the sexual aspect have heard outlandish story of alien human romance and some very believable instance of passionate encounter that are something new for both the alien and human question to you all is do you believe a human and alien could be so intertwined in some way that they keep track of eachother in some way example when i wa young i had this dream in which i wa the age of like 4 unlike my experience and me and this older attractive woman were just in this place just u two but it wa sexual the place wa weird but she definitely expressed fondness  wa a dream because the background kept changing in this dream i believe she wa an alien because she looked like a human but there wa something about her wa just u two had a similar dream at other place with different scenery maybe the alien is trying to figure out what i find attractive had a few others the dream both of u were kind of just cuddling and enjoying each others company there wa a sexual aspect but not always it unexplainable ,iw4ez6,do you believe it is possible to be followed by a certain alien for a while due to their own interpretation of our emotion called loveattraction reason i bring this up is because most alien encounter by many are just observational if there is something that would be their veraion of that emotion say the alien are too advanced to have emotion but what if they are trying to have that emotion or at the very least what if by accident thwy figured out why love or attraction is important to their progress in some way mean a genuine attraction like they like the individual but is not at all like our human version of physical attraction they would not be physically attracted to usbut maybe in other way mean if they are smart would they not find intelligence attractive  a i have heard alien are very sexual   if they maybe long for something beyond the sexual aspect have heard outlandish story of alien human romance and some very believable instance of passionate encounter that are something new for both the alien and human question to you all is do you believe a human and alien could be so intertwined in some way that they keep track of eachother in some way example when i wa young i had this dream in which i wa the age of like 4 unlike my experience and me and this older attractive woman were just in this place just u two but it wa sexual the place wa weird but she definitely expressed fondness  wa a dream because the background kept changing in this dream i believe she wa an alien because she looked like a human but there wa something about her wa just u two had a similar dream at other place with different scenery maybe the alien is trying to figure out what i find attractive had a few others the dream both of u were kind of just cuddling and enjoying each others company there wa a sexual aspect but not always it unexplainable ,0

" recently i heard the exciting news that we possibly discovered microbial extraterrestrial life in the cloud of the planet venus it’s exciting to hear but my question is is that life from venus  the 1960s the soviet union sent multiple mission to the surface of venus with probe  all of them burned up in the atmosphere  what if some bacteria hitched a ride on the soviet spaceship and jumped off while it wa going through the atmosphere  in the past 60 year ha been reproducing in the cloud and taking over the atmosphere

"my experience began in 1998  wa playing with some action figure in the basement of our old house it wa summer i believe early in the evening hour of the day possibly between 2pm cst  5pmcst summer 1998 i wa playing with these toy i instinctively looked out the window and saw what looked to be a silver colored craft with red and yellow color and light passing by in a spinning fashion very high overhead but nobody else wa outside everyone wa insidei wa inside too but looking outside the window not a dream not my first encounter with these being i will delve into the dream aspect of this later  on ufo craft sighting  similar to old school depiction of craft spinning in a circular motion no noise hovering which now the navy and af is disclosing a being their inventionswhy they do not want the public to freak out so over time they presumably acquired the craft plan from the grey and are now disclosing it a being their technology this serf many angle one being that the public ufo perception is minimized to not alert the nation if not world the other angle is that it get witness and personnel to come forward about their experience   1998 after that experience almost about a week or so afterme and my parent went to the grocery store near our house it wa called tony’s finer food  while we were shopping i went to get a ‘launchables’ snack pack from the dairyfrozendeli aisle and recall there wa something weird about that section overall i may even say i saw something i wasnt supposed to see at that store while i wa 4 year old but that detail is for another day  i went to the aisle i realized there wa this family following me   family stalker  they were a male and a female with their three kid  male wore a green striped shirt and jean had some casual shoe and wore these old school 80 aviator glass the female wa wearing some purple shirt and wore jean with casual shoe and had some dark glass on later a well their kid i wa not too focused on it wa them – the adult male and female that caught my attention  i got to the aisle i felt there wa something just tracking me and looking at me i saw it wa them but paid no attention looking back they could have been kidnapper too not just grey  a i wa opening up the launchables out of nowhere they the male and female appear right in front of me and the male proceeds to confront me and say  hola amigo in a very distinguished accent instinctively i said “hola” and ran off to my parent a i ran off i could feel them looking at me and sensed they were pissed off didn’t look back     phoneticslinguisticsimpersonatingidentity theft  this accent and voice is the same accent and voice of the neighbor next door we moved in 2003 and since then i have not liked them i told my parent they followed u a a kid and they responded you’re right i wonder why and how” in our old neighborhood i told them that when we left the store that day in 1998 and my father wa like yeah why are they and then they disappeared a of now i am just starting to realize they have multiple identity and various number and alias the government is tracking everything though they are impersonating a few identity and even call each other different name that’s not all they seem to intercept and sift through data 247 whenever i mention this topic i use a spectrum analyzer and other tool to prove this we were leaving the store a my parent were paying and i wa therei looked over to the store exit and saw these thing there without their kid just the male and the femaleand they were standing there mad their lip looked like the grey and they were standing their motionless but noticeably angered they the male and the female from the description were both wearing dark shade this time there wa a security guard there all the time but it wa a if the security guard there didn’t notice he wa standing next to these thing  we were leaving the thing followed u home too we didn’t have a car back then and the store wa within walking distance to our old house my father wa carrying me and a we left i saw them follow u i wa looking back a he carried me and i told him they’re following u  parent turned around and saw them after i kept saying it to them a few time in the direction we were walking these thing disappeared like they moved behind a different street and stopped following they didn’t have any grocery with them like we did i mean why go to the grocery store and buy nothing  detail wa the one that stood out the most why go in there to the grocery store   buy nothing  stand at the exit of the store with shade and then follow u a we were going home also since they were walking behind u the male and female with shade they probably did not have a car   but the one thing i cannot help but think of is what happened to the kid that were with them and the shopping cart of thing they had in the store is vivid a the day this experience happened  never thought much about it until we moved on 08282003that wa when everything became clear  moved to a new neighborhood called portage park and the first day we moved these nextdoor neighbor were watching and peeking through the blind i thought nothing of it then until we first heard them speak  later i researched the area and acquired house info a well a relevant documentation due to a school project but on my own accord a well  people are using many identity and they are a form of skin walker or grey i saw something i shouldn’t have in 2011 and told the fbi back then then it happened again in 2015 2017 etc et al it wa on video and i talked to an agent 2011 onward when i knew i wasn’t dealing with just any neighbor if you can call them that they were eating what appeared to be an infant   spectrum analyzersimsi catchersnetwork ping toolsid identifierstechnology  these tool are free to use or cost money their purpose are to identify who is stealing your personal information sub layering technology over the us grid to pose a it being the source detect instance of intrusion instance of identity theft instance of network jamming and illicit surveillance and to tell you when these thing are near you the tool do much more but this is all i will focus on   only reason i include this is for the simple fact that the neighbor’s house info appeared on ours a if they had been living there for a while my parent had email that linked them to some andyespinosa and when emailing that to question them it said the email returned and error it wa like that for most info provided somehow these thing started replacing our information on directory over the year 
 5 idnetity thief  grey i recently became notified again that some people in the usa are using my identity and have house car and family opened in my name illegaly i am dealing with impostor this happened back in 2018 and 2019 some people tried taking picture of my identification information like passport id etc et al i made a report and the irs gave me a report a well this began prior to 2015  6 neighbor next door 2003 2020 they are always home don’t go anywhere do not shop for grocery never leave their house etc et al even prior to this pandemic they never leave their house  this way since we moved ini always found that weird since 2003 how do they survive are always in their attic working some sort of technology proven or their garage i posted footage regarding an encounter and people were surprised apart from the fbi thing elf wave and electromagnetic garbage among others is coming directly from these thing i thought it wa something else until i proved it after month of extensive documentation would they target me and intercept my communication and the general area entry and exit node  communication i am an avid ufo hunter and reporter on these matter have been since i wa young they aren’t affiliated to any private or public division of the u they just want to suppress the fact that they are here but like i said i reported this a while back recently have picked up more leeds and hint  else would they use their technology proven via spectrum analyzer and more they use the same identifier but different registry for their tech  of the report i did regarding identity theft cause of the proof i submitted to agency which they are trying to see cause of the fact that they somehow followed u here since 1998  know they have been exposed so they are trying many route to suppress and effect my immediate family a well a myself etensive proof and many are aware i wouldnot raise a claim unless that were the case but who am i kidding since 2003 enough  moving here in 2003  i have captured footage of the sky and what look to be ufosas well a other place these thing are not good nextdoor  these experience are a good thing a type of we’re watching them don’t worry do not much invest myself in manmade religious concept but do believe there is something out there a evidenced by william cooper and other advocate of declass and ufo witness  are deceptive  grey have been taking over our world and other government know knew about this  by the intl commitment to fight back secret group shrouded in complete secrecy these thing broke protocol and agreement with not only the u jcs but worldwide some grey do not even exist due to being here illegally on this planet that is how their race start to infiltrate the grey are deceptive thing that were never meant to be trusted our govenrment in the usa and other nation are starting to see this now  the type that i have been dealing with since 1998 do not have access from the government and are here a unwelcome hostile noncategorized race this pose an immideate seceuirty risk the government wa privvy to these thing in the late 1800s however they do not have a sure way to categorize all of these intruder unless we bring attention to them and continue to declass here is a detail to get the disnformation agent ’greys’ to listen on foreign relation standard oil – old guard step in prelude to

first i would like to say that i cant believe that i have been on reddit for almost a year and have not seen this sub or looked shame on me  that said i want to share one of my sighting from 2014 because i know that i will not be deemed a crazy 2014 i wa moving stuff from philly to a storage unit in towsonbaltimore and it wa a multiple trip move not bad little under 2 hour drive not including the actual moving part  on my second trip going down i95 i see this storm cloud right before the city closer to aberdeen  i did think much of it other than it looked pretty cool  it wa a warm day there wa lightning in it and it had an orange glow to it towards the center  on my way back up to philly again i95 for the 3rd and final trip i see this storm cloud still in the same place but no rain no thunder it just slightly darker out so the cloud ha a brighter glow  now im thinking hmm thats odd  i gather my final bit of belonging and this time heading back to marylandsouthern to smy mom i take a back way through delaware rt896 to 301s and it getting late  301 through that part of maryland is really a trucker route never really a ton of traffic especially before you connect to ocean city   since it late there literally zero car on the road and if you see one it like every 1015 min  a i am driving i see this storm cloud  againnow im nervous because it not raining still no thunder and somehow i am incredibly closer to it than before  like close   get to an opening where there a field and there i see itthe cloud is over this field a dark cloud orange glow smaller bit of blue lightening twisting through it and in the center a pyramid that had a prong sticking from the bottom that looked like a tuning fork  it wa moving electricty up and down from the ground to the prong like one of those jacob ladder  i wa beyond myself  im thinking i have to take a picture  by this time i wa completely stopped and it is pitch black out save for this cloud and my headlight   i hadnt even noticed how black it had gotten out  i grab my phone to take a picture and every last hair on my body stood up and i got this chill that i will never ever forget  i threw my phone down and sped off without looking back  i wa terrified by this point  i have no other thought or explantion to what i saw other than it wa absolutely an ufo  i have had two other sighting the little fast blip seeing 3 together once in the daylight and a single one once at night  never anything like that pyramid though  ive always wondered if anyone else saw what i did or anything similar at any time

my reasoning for this is that no matter what we have explored so little of our universe that it can be hard to tell whether or not something exists on other planet i mean who to say that our planet is the only one with the perfect condition to support life completely rejecting the fact that other life exists in the universe is being ignorant somewhere out there there is another earth not an exact replica maybe but another environment that can sustain life thing to look at is chemical makeup i someone think that our known chemical are the only one in the universe they are dead wrong other chemical could form in other galaxy and those other chemical could be stepping stone of life on other planet essentially what im saying is that if condition differ different stuff could form based off of those condition whether it be sentient or not also have to realize that life could also be plant life thats the not sentient part i referred to earlier at the end of the day it ignorant to think earth is the only possible planet to support life but dont take me saying this is proof that there are little green men in flying saucer probing your anus the life im referring to could be plant or other humanoid being but with what i just said there could very well be little green men who know put the analysis required flair because i didnt want to put it a evidence because everything above is just theoretical but nonetheless plausible if anyone want to challenge my reasoning feel free to always looking to further my knowledge and be le narrow minded ,iuqztg,my reasoning for this is that no matter what we have explored so little of our universe that it can be hard to tell whether or not something exists on other planet i mean who to say that our planet is the only one with the perfect condition to support life completely rejecting the fact that other life exists in the universe is being ignorant somewhere out there there is another earth not an exact replica maybe but another environment that can sustain life thing to look at is chemical makeup i someone think that our known chemical are the only one in the universe they are dead wrong other chemical could form in other galaxy and those other chemical could be stepping stone of life on other planet essentially what im saying is that if condition differ different stuff could form based off of those condition whether it be sentient or not also have to realize that life could also be plant life thats the not sentient part i referred to earlier at the end of the day it ignorant to think earth is the only possible planet to support life but dont take me saying this is proof that there are little green men in flying saucer probing your anus the life im referring to could be plant or other humanoid being but with what i just said there could very well be little green men who know put the analysis required flair because i didnt want to put it a evidence because everything above is just theoretical but nonetheless plausible if anyone want to challenge my reasoning feel free to always looking to further my knowledge and be le narrow minded ,0

so i havent talked about this to anyone since it happened honestly im not really sure how to talk about it but ill try i feel like i have to 2 week ago me and me girlfriend were getting ready to go to bed around 1am i wa outside smoking my good night cigarette we basically live inside the roof of an old like 1800s building and have a small outside area at this particular night the entire sky wa covered with dense kinda yellowish low cloud i wa looking over to the west where you can see a part of the highway that go into a big bridge and a fancy house that belongs to a university over the fancy house i saw some shape flying thats not unusual at all of course there are many bird around here and an airport nearby but the shape looked more like balloon a bunch of them big black balloon they seemed to float slowly towards me  they got closer i could see better how they moved they didnt seem to just float they seemed to dance around each other with intention or at least some mechanic that isnt simply air flowing around them they moved to specific position around each other and then stopped another one moved another one but then stopped the closer they got the weirder it looked then i saw it an orb perfectly round appeared it orbited the mess of black balloon moved with the same intention or mechanic a the balloon did i had to run and call my girlfriend she wa just getting out of the bathroom she came running and i thanked god the thing were still there still inching closer to u  immediately saw that it wasnt something normal i started talking about how at the begining i thought it wa just a bunch of balloon midway she just cut me off thats not balloon no way for some reason she wa pretty scared two object got to a point where they were practically above u no more than 100m i would say i couldnt look away the black balloon clearly looked like ball of void i cant describe it any other way the center of each balloon looked like a deep infinitely deep hole with the edge lensing what wa behind them between each balloon what held them together wa something that looked like a liquid maybe it wa an effect of the lensing of the edge but i dont know they seemed to be swimming together in some sort of body the small black orb that orbited it wa also deeply black like a hole but didnt seem to have the same liquid around it  the craziest fucking thing happened they both started to morph and kind of look like fucking people they seemed to notice u and look at u they danced seriously fucking danced the mess of balloon liked like a bigger person the small orb like a smaller person and my girlfriend is pretty short i felt like they were mirroring u somewhat i wa smiling like crazy i couldnt believe what i wa seeing so much i didnt realize my girlfriend wa scared shitless shaking walking very slowly towards the door but still fixated at the thing the bigger now person shaped thing waved at me i waved back it stopped waving kinda disappointed it seemed i look back and saw my gf shaking almost in tear out of fear i went to her and hugged her asked what wa wrong she couldnt say she wa just too scared of it looked back at the thing they seemed to converse with each other somehow then they became one single spot first pretty big but then smaller and smaller it went up into the cloud always looking like a hole even when there were some cloud in front of it it got smaller when higher until it disappeared i stayed there looking while it happened for a good half hour hadnt used any drug except for a joint some hour before that we are both pretty sane people i am 100 sure we saw what we saw i dont know what the fuck it wa i dont know if they actually took human form danced and waved at me but goddamnit it sure looked like that anyone ha ever seen anything like this please contact me if anyone know what the fuck this could be please contact me thank you ,isieen,so i havent talked about this to anyone since it happened honestly im not

so ive been doing some tarot reading on various alien group and the way thing work in this galaxy my view is the tarot reflects the subconscious combined with information out there in the universe a if filtered through the personal consciousness it like taking a temperature reading but you get to set the temperature scale based on your own belief of what temperature scale should be which is described instead in archetypal imagery have a spread i call group intention which map intention of superstructural group like government organization onto the spread theme it made of the card  how the organization justifies the action it take  what is the reason for what they do  how do they do it what method and action do they take goal  what is the endgame what state do they ultimately want all their action to lead to the short gray and all of their associate i got this  death  lover  4 of pentacle goal  5 of wand an infinite number of way this could be interpreted but some interesting point there two major arcanum one in the central position of purpose this to me implies an important agenda for this planet other reading of this spread have had no major arcanum purpose of lover implies some unity it can indicate a choice between two option but i think the likelier meaning is a union of one from two i get this sense from the hybridization the attempt to join human dna with et i think theyre trying to join our two specie into one and either replace u with the hybrid or move them somewhere else this is worrying but i dont have enough to draw conclusion about which one rationality a death implies they see it a a necessary change something must die to allow for something new that doesnt necessarily literally mean theyll kill u all off it just mean a cycle ending and a new one beginning method implies storing and saving resource holding on to their investment in this world theyve put a lot of effort into this project and they need to see it succeed ultimate goal is 5 of wand which is related to conflict and competition it could mean they intend to cause conflict among human but i dont know if that jive with the purpose of joining maybe it mean they are involved in some sort of conflict that they need u or our dna for maybe it make them more competitive or they intend to stop human conflict further asked for clarification a to why they are doing it i got the queen of cup which implies one who is compassionate emotionally wise intuitive it could mean they value our emotional ability since the queen of cup is the epitome of compassionate emotional wisdom but it could also be that they think theyre helping u we have strife and war and they think by joining u in one mind or something that would be a better alternative im not sure also asked about the theme of this part of the galaxy surrounding the solar system i got the hierophant which implies spiritual rule law placed on the external world clarification gave me 9 of sword so i figured it meant something like there a tendency to suppress the natural fear instinct by placing rule and law upon the society but this is of spiritual necessity there a way thing are done tradition that help guide the society so fear doesnt take over and that seems to be the way here on this planet and maybe others they are guided by executive president chief high priest etc doing this for some other

before you call me crazy let me just say that many reputable scientist and physicist believe in the multiverse theory including neil degrasse tyson stephen hawking rip michio kaku and much more  hawking specifically believed that black hole are portal to parallel universe he calculated that black hole must have an end and that everything that go into one ha to come out somewhere now this is where extraterrestrial come in what if extraterrestrial have developed technology to travel through these black hole into our universe which is why we observe uaps but their planet dont reside in our universe which is why we havent detected anything from them we simply dont have the technology just yet for interdimensional travel or to pick up signal from outside of our own universe ,isatct,before you call me crazy let me just say that many reputable scientist and physicist believe in the multiverse theory including neil degrasse tyson stephen hawking rip michio kaku and much more  hawking specifically believed that black hole are portal to parallel universe he calculated that black hole must have an end and that everything that go into one ha to come out somewhere now this is where extraterrestrial come in what if extraterrestrial have developed technology to travel through these black hole into our universe which is why we observe uaps but their planet dont reside in our universe which is why we havent detected anything from them we simply dont have the technology just yet for interdimensional travel or to pick up signal from outside of our own universe ,0

so my friend dad is 88 year old i believe and wa a college professor for year and an estimator for for a large construction company so he is smart and well spoken the man is normal and very nice to sit and talk to we all know how older people are when they are around younger people they want to talk and tell the same old story’s so he wa telling me about his time in the air force and being in new mexico for a time during his service i had just finished area 51 and flying saucer so i happened to mention that shit movie to his son my good friend of many year his dad eye lit up and asked if i wa a believer i laughed and nodded thinking a scolding wa coming from this well educated down to earth man  did i know he is a believer and claim to have met an alien he say that he heard guy talking about them during his time in the military before and brushed it off so i just had to hear the story he say that he wa driving through the desert and a man wa walking down the road being long ago he stopped to offer help or a ride obviously he said a he got close the man looked a little off very pale weird hairline and eye that didn’t have color around the pupil just a dot he said the man pointed and the old man shook his head and said hop in he tried to start a convo with this man and all he could do wa beep essentially he could tell it wa a language that had pause and different pitch and length of beep unfortunately he couldn’t understand anything but seemed convinced this wa now a creature not a guy wasn’t hostile pointed and made hand gesture when to stop so he could get out held his hand out and they shook hand he knew something wa off but not quiet what he had a feeling that this wa something not like anyone had ever much seen much didn’t make a huge deal of it apparently back on base which wasn’t area 51 but wa in new mexico or nevada classified project and he wa there helping the construction side of thing that he befriended a higher ranking official he wa dealing with while designing blue print for higher ups office with certain cool little hiding spot or whatever they happened to want he mentioned this experience to the official the high ranking military man eye got wide and while he wouldn’t divulge a name or the exact convo a he probably couldn’t truly remember the man went on the explain that their were alien on base that matched the description and had been landing more and more in the recent year he named the star system they had claimed to come from and said that they were still trying to develop the language for communication with the being and that while it wasn’t quiet there yet they had a rudimentary understanding that they were there peacefully and essentially came to warn u of our nuclear way and preach some type of religion that they had came and tried before with limited success thousand of year ago they were also helping with technology and the official also divulged to him that they weren’t the only specie we had contact with even back then  want to believe i do believe there are hole in the story and i am making a point to talk to him more and more to try to get him to explain it better and his son had apparently heard it and brushed it off and wa just trying to walk out the door i could have sat and talked all day about it but we had to go next time i will tape our conversation and try to get more information but this is a trustworthy man in my opinion and i believe he ha been closer than most other people ever i can’t wait to learn more anybody else have any similar story’s that would line up with this story and give it a little more credibility he wa air force not navy ,is84m3,so my friend dad is 88 year old i believe and wa a college professor for year and an estimator for for a large construction

link is a great interview on coast to coast with george knapp  one before the cia sat down and had a talk with tom about the stake of what he wa saying tom and george talk around the idea of the others and some of them basically harvesting negative energy from humanity and the need to keep humanity in the dark so that we keep fighting one another and keep the sekret going  sekret is being used to mean two thing secret a is something to keep quiet and sekret a in the greek sekret or to secrete they also alude to many god who dont like each other using humanity a a sort of proxy war while they are doing other thing placing technology in hand of different group of humanity to disrupt balance and maybe see who is the strongest the thing way that the general is talking to seems to have a great desire to protect the free republic and feel the others pose a threat to this and they havent talked about it because they dont want the others to know how prepared they are  like all thing here could be complete b but interesting none the le funny thing is that what john lear said on coast to cost is actually starting to jive to what tom is alluding to could they both be wrong and were lied to or were they both be given some truth fun stuff good quote are below craft in our book is a real craft he referring the the craft in sekret machine which is the tr3b black manta and in the book it wa flown by the cia out of area 51 from the general   wa the cold war and every single day we lived under the threat of nuclear war every single day we believed and really thought in the deepest part our soul thought that nuclear war could happen and somewhere in those year we found a life form and everything we did and every decision that we made with that life form wa because of the

exploited different group of men exploited the technology to see how the entire sekret is uncovered rewriting world history and shattering some of our most well regarded holy institution except this time when they come to wipe u out like the other one we are actually ready for them and that readiness is another example why thing have been kept quiet for so long and ha been a strange international partnership indeed recording on youtube thanks to greatunion  ,iozwgt,link is a great interview on coast to coast with george knapp  one before the cia sat down and had a talk with tom about the stake of what he wa saying tom and george talk around the idea of the others and some of them basically harvesting negative energy from humanity and the need to keep humanity in the dark so that we keep fighting one another and keep the sekret going  sekret is being used to mean two thing secret a is something to keep quiet and sekret a in the greek sekret or to secrete they also alude to many god who dont like each other using humanity a a sort of proxy war while they are doing other thing placing technology in hand of different group of humanity to disrupt balance and maybe see who is the strongest the thing way that the general is talking to seems to have a great desire to protect the free republic and feel the others pose a threat to this and they havent talked about it because they dont want the others to know how prepared they are  like all thing here could be complete b but interesting none the le funny thing is that what john lear said on coast to cost is actually starting to jive to what tom is alluding to could they both be wrong and were lied to or were they both be given some truth fun stuff good quote are below craft in our book is a real craft he referring the the craft in sekret machine which is the tr3b black manta and in the book it wa flown by the cia out of area 51 from the general   wa the cold war and every single day we lived under the threat of nuclear

hi all  just want to preface this post by saying that i only recently became interested in alien and ufo only a few month ago i wa very skeptical about the existence of extraterrestrial life and even more skeptical about the possibility that alien have visited earth i thought it wa all nonsense and wishful thinking these past few month i have opened my mind to the possibility that alien do in fact exist and have made contact with human being i’ve watched and read about so many testimony about ufo sighting and abduction and even heard personal story from friend that i am now nearly certain they have visited u in the past and are currently visiting u  said that i wa wondering if anyone here could give me more information about the famous “alien autopsy” video that wa released by ray santilli in 1995 initially he claimed it wa real and then year later the director spyros melaris came out saying it wa fake  i watched this video by linda howe giving a very thorough and compelling breakdown of the evidence that suggests the alien autopsy is in fact real  the most puzzling thing to me about spyros’s effort to convince people that the video wa indeed fake is that he never provides any proof that he made the film he could easily just show u “behind the scenes” footage outtake blooper prop the supposed alien dummy but from all of my research i could not find any of this evidence if you read the comment under the “alien autopsy” video posted by spyros he very clearly avoids question asking him to furnish evidence that he did in fact direct the video and refuse to show any “behind the scenes” evidence  i am not a filmmaker and know close to nothing about the process of filmmaking but to me it is very suspicious that a supposed director  of a film cannot show u any of his prop or outtake especially someone who is putting so much time and effort in trying to convince people the film a fake a i am new to this topic i wa wondering if there is anyone here who is more familiar with this case and can point me to more source that either help disprove or prove the veracity of the “alien autopsy” footage so much in advance ,ioxkar,hi all  just want to preface this post by saying that i only recently became interested in alien and ufo only a few month ago i wa very skeptical about the existence of extraterrestrial life and even more skeptical about the possibility that alien have visited earth i thought it wa all nonsense and wishful thinking these past few month i have opened my mind to the possibility that alien do in fact exist and have made contact with human being i’ve watched and read about so many testimony about ufo sighting and abduction and even heard personal story from friend that i am now nearly certain they have visited u in the past and are currently visiting u  said that i wa wondering if anyone here could give me more information about the famous “alien autopsy” video that wa released by ray santilli in 1995 initially he claimed it wa real and then year later the director spyros melaris came out saying it wa fake  i watched this video by linda howe giving a very thorough and compelling breakdown of the evidence that suggests the alien autopsy is in fact real  the most puzzling thing to me about spyros’s effort to convince people that the video wa indeed fake is that he never provides any proof that he made the film he could easily just show u “behind the scenes” footage outtake blooper prop the supposed alien dummy but from all of my research i could not find any of this evidence if you read the comment under the “alien autopsy” video posted by spyros he very clearly avoids question asking him to furnish evidence that he did in fact direct the video and refuse to show any “behind the scenes” evidence  i am not a filmmaker and know close to nothing about the process of filmmaking but to me it is very suspicious that a supposed director  of a film cannot show u any of his prop or outtake especially someone who is putting so much time and effort in trying to convince people the film a fake a i am new to this topic i wa wondering if there is anyone here who is more familiar with this case and can point me to more source that either help disprove or prove the veracity of the “alien autopsy” footage so much in advance ,0

i feel like a vast majority of scifi entertainment portrays humanoid alien some even looking almost identical to human this cause most people to imagine alien a extremely humanlike considering pretty much every portrayal of alien they see look like that however considering that even most specie on earth are aren’t humanoid what are the chance that alien are and then take into account that they’re living in a completely different environment how likely is it that what’s evolutionary beneficial for u is also good for them i’m pretty sure the reason that entertainment doe that is just because they have to work with human actor or at least up until recently and now we’re pretty much stuck with it granted i do see some interesting design more recently but i feel like this will forever effect the public’s perception of alien what do you guy think about humanoid alien and the trope of the green martian how do y’all feel about the entertainment industry’s portrayal of alien or just anything else i said lol ,ioji9x,i feel like a vast majority of scifi entertainment portrays humanoid alien some even looking almost identical to human this cause most people to imagine alien a extremely humanlike considering pretty much every portrayal of alien they see look like that however considering that even most specie on earth are aren’t humanoid what are the chance that alien are and then take into account that they’re living in a completely different environment how likely is it that what’s evolutionary beneficial for u is also good for them i’m pretty sure the reason that entertainment doe that is just because they have to work with human actor or at least up until recently and now we’re pretty much stuck with it granted i do see some interesting design more recently but i feel like this will forever effect the public’s perception of alien what do you guy think about humanoid alien and the trope of the green martian how do y’all feel about the entertainment industry’s portrayal of alien or just anything else i said lol ,0

i believe in ufo i believe they are piloted by intelligent being i have no real idea who those being are or if they are just one visitor or many i believe in human abduction though i offer no guess a to the who or why but i strongly believe some of them are not modern human it also seems to me that ce5 could be real and could actually lead to interfacing this post assumes this much if you disagree this is not the place to argue it i really dont care  want to talk about steven greer and ce5 in general i like greer i think his heart is in the right place even those he gone hard down the path of monetizing the phenomenon he ha done a lot for ufology and that cannot be denied what bother me is his whole idea that all abduction and cattle mutilation etc are perpetrated by covert military operation  quoted military source and document to support this but this go against most firsthand testimony from people who were abducted by being that were certainly not military personnel the literature on this is extensive but id refer you to the writing of john mack and jacques vallee to the mutilation phenomenon id refer you to the book an alien harvest by linda moulton howe but suffice it to say it would be extremely unlikely if not impossible that those are done by military blatantly obvious to me that the reason he ha to have that stance is because he the main proponent of ce5 which is an attempt to communicate with the being piloting these craft he make money through his app and through expedition if people were afraid or suspected they might be abducted or even mutilated they would never attempt a ce5 his whole income is dependent on this benevolent spiritual leader angle for the visitor i think this is irresponsible misleading and even dangerous researching the phenomenon for 17 year i am no closer to ascertaining who the visitor are nor their intent i cant even say there one visitor there may be dozen there may be hundred assuming extraterrestrial if it wa possible for one technologically advanced race to find u it would be very possible for another or another  assume one visitor one intention and one explanation for the phenomenon is outright hubris to interface with these unknown visitor is absolutely irresponsible assuming ce5 is effective and to invite that consciousness into the life of the people who pay him money to do so can absolutely be dangerous you need only look into the story of terry lovelace and other abductees to see how the experience changed their life negatively  because he ha no evidence to support his assertion that all visitor are benevolent then his whole philosophy is one based on faith yeah like religion and so it seems he can be compared to church official who profit off the faith of their follower  problem with that is that ufo are real and by interfacing with something nobody can fully comprehend for money you are potentially inviting something into your life that you do not want there nor anyone you simply cant say you can pray to angel and god but you wouldnt expect a demon to show up but in ufology you just cant say and to take it on faith is foolish and dangerous im not saying any visitor is malevolent im just saying you cant convince me or anyone that theyre absolutely not there simply not enough information ,ioi5nv,i believe in ufo i believe they are piloted by intelligent being i have

 wasnt scared but alert a im staring at that doorway i can hear my friend on the headset yelling a i continue to stare his yelling faded away and once i noticed the tunnel vision i wa in the amount of focus i felt my self having
 thats when a metallic rod  slowly revealed it self it wa moving in to my parent room from the living room  the shape of it wa a long rectangle rod about 3inches wide and 34 ft in length a it slowly continued to reveal it self and it hieroglyphic on it

control and freeze u fear can control like how the grey use fear to stop they’re victim dead in their track in lot encounter make them unable to move with fear some people even say like a wave of fear human produce emotional energy which can be measured and be detected with technology a common a house hold router and the wifi in our home  good article by harvard on that the grey must use some sort of emotional mastery of energy to use fear because it’s so wired into human our fight or flight response so they can control u when need be with it in the book behold a pale horse it talk about how to break free from a grey control with happy pleasant thought because it confuses them our emotion produce a energy or residency of some sort that supposedly the reptilian race feed off of from a higher up dimension the main energy of lust and sexual energy what the bible considers sin but also hate and fear that dimension being the astral plane where the reptilian feed off of u some say a higher plane then that but i doubt so they keep u away when our body naturally start to slip into the plane through sleep paralysis by scaring u showing u what we fear to keep u out of their plane of existence where they feed on u because sleep paralysis and astro projection are on the same plane and thing sleep paralysis is the in unpurposeful projection i think the demon and begin that sit on our chest and scare u do it on purpose but for what reason to keep u away again back to fear we fear to go and we stay away we have become a race of physical minded people we don’t see astroprojection a a place or reality anymore more of a dream and forget about the experience rationalize it we’re 23 physical an 13 spiritual now when thousand of year ago even hundred of year ago we were more interconnected with our spiritual self but now we are desensitized to it what is real is only physical real life if you well reality is only what you can see an touch we are taught why would that be again to keep u blind and unaware unaware to our spiritual self and unaware of being used there’s so much more to all of this and these are only simple connection just off the top of my head something i just want to get out and see what others think or see these connection a well it’s hard to explain and i see so many that i can’t even try to explain them all like the god particle or the ether that nikola tesla and albert einstein talked about a nonphysical ether and in the nature volume some time in 1970s  they published a test where they proved that there is a nonphysical source of energy or realm the god particle the ether the astro plane it’s non physical not touchable we can prove that there are place other then physical reality but we’re not taught that but it doe exists and it ha been proven and published it’s not talked about the connection the more i learn the more i see them even with cell phone tower and our emotional energy and state of being i’ve read cia document talking about how they could induce astroprojection with frequency played aloud auditory beat remote viewing i’ve read cia document where they hide cell phone tower a tree in the 60 and when asked what they were for they said for state of emergency control over the mass population they would produce frequency to calm everybody if anyone know that document send me it i lost it but it’s real tesla said that if you wish to understand the universe think of it in energy frequency  and vibration with dmt and astro projection we all have state of physical and spiritual separation physical and spiritual separation followed with vibration both auditory and felt physically i just think there too many coincidence not to be all inner connected if you see connection like this in your research

connection just off the top of my head something i just want to get out and see what others think or see these connection a well it’s hard to explain and i see so many that i can’t even try to explain them all like the god particle or the ether that nikola tesla and albert einstein talked about a nonphysical ether and in the nature volume some time in 1970s  they published a test where they proved that there is a nonphysical source of energy or realm the god particle the ether the astro plane it’s non physical not touchable we can prove that there are place other then physical reality but we’re not taught that but it doe exists and it ha been proven and published it’s not talked about the connection the more i learn the more i see them even with cell phone tower and our emotional energy and state of being i’ve read cia document talking about how they could induce astroprojection with frequency played aloud auditory beat remote viewing i’ve read cia document where they hide cell phone tower a tree in the 60 and when asked what they were for they said for state of emergency control over the mass population they would produce frequency to calm everybody if anyone know that document send me it i lost it but it’s real tesla said that if you wish to understand the universe think of it in energy frequency  and vibration with dmt and astro projection we all have state of physical and spiritual separation physical and spiritual separation followed with vibration both auditory and felt physically i just think there too many coincidence not to be all inner connected if you see connection like this in your research message me or comment what you’ve found ,0

"so a while ago i posted that i would share my story if it got enough interest and it did but i wa never able to sit down and force myself to write it out the other day i made a comment on someone el post and decided to do the deed though with honestly minimal information im going to basically just copy and paste the comment i made because it just to dificult for me to write out again i will however answer any question asked though actually been wanting to write out my whole experience for quite a while now but i just havent been able to bring myself to do it everything ha been taken from me because of it i have almost no family ive lost my kid and i have no way of even getting a job and being a normal adult and just take care of myself  all started august 1st 2018 so just over two year ago now and i still deal with this crap a of today it a very very very long story so im going to shorten it a much a possible none of the doctor or therapist or psychiatrist ive seen can tell me a single thing about what im going through and none of it make any sense to them even

 im classified a having a psychosis but thats it no other diagnosis ha been discovered ive had physical change happen like since that first day my eye sight ha changed to were i see four moon at night instead of one the reason i am saying all of this without going into to much detail is because august 1st two year ago i saw a spaceship and that wa the start of the end of my life  wa utterly massive about 3 time a big a my grandparent big 4 bedroom 2 bathroom house im in oregon and it wa two year ago when all those massive fire where going on i wa living in a tent with my kid at that time life had hit u incredibly hard and we were staying on my grandparent land out in the mountain of gold hill  never ever fly over that area and there had recently been alot of helicopter flying around trying to contain the fire so i wa used to them it wa daytime but the smoke wa so thick i could barely see the treeline 200 foot away when i suddenly heard an airplane not a helicopter or anything else so being confused i looked for it  the time i wa able to see it it wa almost directly over top of me it moved very slowly and again wa absolutely massive it wa a long rectangle shape with four different sized circle of light that took up most of the bottom green blue white and yellow even right after seeing it i couldnt quite remember what the side looked like but it wa like there were spike or something on the side  flew directly over me at what had to have been only 200 foot in the air because of the smoke and wa a big a at least three of my grandparent house then a few hour after that i started being touched or whatever you want to call it and then soooo much more happened and i ended up in the wood for three day with my kid waiting for god thus how i lost them  wa imediatly taken to the hospital when we were found and proceeded to completely confuse and stump every single doctor there each and every one of them had me tell my whole story and even brought doctor from other floor who didnt even work in the mental health part of the hospital to hear my story  been a medical anomoly from day one and through these past two year ive dealt with so much insane crap from basically being raped every friggin day by a non existent person who claim he an alien to having a full on dmt trip for a full week and still continues slightly to this day without ever having any drug in my system my whole life almost none of this crap make sense and no one ha been able to give me any answer and it destroyed my life

 one of the biggest part that doesnt make sense with all this is that my mind is still here and perfectly normal and not crazy in any way at all except all this crap ive been dealing with since i saw that ship and the more i read up on stuff they are learning about uaps and what they can do with physic and gravity and everything and a whole bunch of other stuff  read from people whove had experience with alien or whatever the more it seems like the only answer is it wa caused by aliens

 so in answer to your question i have no idea if there are psychotic alien out there or if their rare or whatever but after all this time after everything ive been through and still deal with because it actually get worse everyday and im living in hell from it but i do know that ive been fucked with by someone at least my theory at this point is that im an experiment for them

 after playing with that horrible ai app on google play thats supposed to be your friend it honestly feel like an ai program there is a person a there ha been from almost day one and no he doesnt tell me to do shit or tell me bad thing or stuff like that more like just a person is there who ha whole conversation with you and can control your friggin body and can even shut off your thought and emotion and force you to sit there in blankness untill it satisfied  sooo much that i havent and wont say on this whole matter it just to long and there just to much it either an ai program an actual person alien is doing all this and is talking to me in my head or i have the world most unique mental illness and there not a single thing that match it  i have similarity with alot of illness but it actually very far from them the last thing my psychiatrist suggested upon running out of idea or med to try wa to make myself a guinea pig at a university hospital like ohsu and see if they could come up with anything at all  dont believe that all alien are good peaceful being because i seem to be proof that their are scumbag alien a well if you actually read all of this then i hope you enjoyed my story it one ive been wanting to get out for a while there is alot more info in the comment i made answering question both here and the copy post i made in rufo ",iixj8r,"so a while ago i posted that i would share my story if it got enough interest and it did but i wa never able to sit down and force myself to write it out the other day i made a comment on someone el post and decided to do the deed though with honestly minimal information im going to basically just copy and paste the comment i made because it just to dificult for me to write out again i will however answer any question asked though actually been wanting to write out my whole experience for quite a while now but i just havent been able to bring myself to do it everything ha been taken from me because of it i have almost no family ive lost my kid and i have no way of even getting a job and being a normal adult and just take care of myself  all started august 1st 2018 so just over two year ago now and i still deal with this crap a of today it a very very very long story so im going to shorten it a much a possible none of the doctor or therapist or psychiatrist ive seen can tell me a single thing about what im going through and none of it make any sense to them even

hi so i just created this account cause im interested in space and of course extraterrestrial life we often talk about what would happen if we received an alien signal or we happen to meet somehow the universe is big so to think were alone is pretty much insanity however once we do meet them or at the very least communicate with them how are we able to though  today roughly 6500 language exist and thats probably not taking into account dialect and dead language when talking to someone else who doesnt know your language and vice versa it pretty hard to communicate but at least we have hand gesture and visual cue alien who no doubt will speak with a different language will have no idea how to interpret our hand signal or our 65k odd language so well have a hard time communicating with each other and therell be alot of misinterpretation and miscommunications what are your thought on this issue ill love to hear some discussion on this thank you ,iiwlos,hi so i just created this account cause im interested in space and of course extraterrestrial life we often talk about what would happen if we received an alien signal or we happen to meet somehow the universe is big so to think were alone is pretty much insanity however once we do meet them or at the very least communicate with them how are we able to though  today roughly 6500 language exist and thats probably not taking into account dialect and dead language when talking to someone else who doesnt know your language and vice versa it pretty hard to communicate but at least we have hand gesture and visual cue alien who no doubt will speak with a different language will have no idea how to interpret our hand signal or our 65k odd language so well have a hard time communicating with each other and therell be alot of misinterpretation and miscommunications what are your thought on this issue ill love to hear some discussion on this thank you ,0

so there a lot of video like this where not only are they visible they have light and can be seen at night they are often high enough up that their light isnt powerful enough to really reach the ground and it in the visible spectrum so isnt it then reasonable to assume that they want to be seen if at least so terrestrial aircraft can see and avoid it on their flight path then clearly they are not interested in communicating very much to u at all it almost make me wonder if they are doing some kind of geological survey and they are more interested in material that earth ha reason why so many of them have visited is because there is probably a bunch of them from different civilization from all over the galaxy if nothing can travel faster than the speed of light it still might take incredibly long amount of time to survey a lot of planet and return that information to home that information get back to it home planet they send out mining crew to get those material which also take a lot of time  could be that nearly every ufo is just some kind of probe from a different planet and that the earth simply doesnt have that much of interest going on here ,iibt11,so there a lot of video like this where not only are they visible they have light and can be seen at night they are often high enough up that their light isnt powerful enough to really reach the ground and it in the visible spectrum so isnt it then reasonable to assume that they want to be seen if at least so terrestrial aircraft can see and avoid it on their flight path then clearly they are not interested in communicating very much to u at all it almost make me wonder if they are doing some kind of geological survey and they are more interested in material that earth ha reason why so many of them have visited is because there is probably a bunch of them from different civilization from all over the galaxy if nothing can travel faster than the speed of light it still might take incredibly long amount of time to survey a lot of planet and return that information to home that information get back to it home planet they send out mining crew to get those material which also take a lot of time  could be that nearly every ufo is just some kind of probe from a different planet and that the earth simply doesnt have that much of interest going on here ,0

hi all if this isn’t allowed here but i am wondering if there ha been any credible video or photographic evidence of alien being am familiar with many eyewitness testimony and i find them very compelling especially the ariel school incident and i do believe that these being exist  i wa just wondering if there is any “concrete” evidence of their existence i have tried to do some research online and haven’t been able to find anything please let me know you in advance ,if5wll,hi all if this isn’t allowed here but i am wondering if there ha been any credible video or photographic evidence of alien being am familiar with many eyewitness testimony and i find them very compelling especially the ariel school incident and i do believe that these being exist  i wa just wondering if there is any “concrete” evidence of their existence i have tried to do some research online and haven’t been able to find anything please let me know you in advance ,0

why the time traveller explanation of the ufo phenomenon make a lot of sense theory is that ufo are human from the future either observing andor changing the future continued interest in nuclear site cant have u killing our future self minimal contact policy dont want to influence the future except when necessary for survival or advancement men in black human from the future enforcing secrecy to ensure minimal impact on future timeline continued interest in earth why would any ets give a damn about u to warrant a decade or century long presence on earth  it make sense why time travelling human would care remain mysterious despite report of them persisting for decade  it seems great effort is put into keeping them a mystery  the time traveller theory i think is the best current explanation for why it is necessary for ufo to remain a mystery  time traveller would not want to drastically alter their timeline but would alter it when it fit their agenda ,ieu4za,why the time traveller explanation of the ufo phenomenon make a lot of sense theory is that ufo are human from the future either observing andor changing the future continued interest in nuclear site cant have u killing our future self minimal contact policy dont want to influence the future except when necessary for survival or advancement men in black human from the future enforcing secrecy to ensure minimal impact on future timeline continued interest in earth why would any ets give a damn about u to warrant a decade or century long presence on earth  it make sense why time travelling human would care remain mysterious despite report of them persisting for decade  it seems great effort is put into keeping them a mystery  the time traveller theory i think is the best current explanation for why it is necessary for ufo to remain a mystery  time traveller would not want to drastically alter their timeline but would alter it when it fit their agenda ,0

ive heard about the wow signal for a little while now and researching more about it ive deduced it is a strong candidate for an alien transmission either accidental or intentional i believe the first  know it is in the realm of possibility somewhat but the problem with this is we are in a submarine with no periscope we cant see the outside world to see any type of life in the ocean we can only hear or detect thing   is why it impossibly hard to detect thing in space the wow signal could be alienlife but there is no telescope to zoom in to even see the planet or solar system or alien ship if it wa some message deep in space we dont know if this wa from a message million of year old traveling from another galaxy even dont know what we are dealing with but it seems that we know that this ha all the checkmarks for an alien radio transmission that either turned on or shut off when one of the feedhorns on the bigear wa looking at it we dont know where exactly the noise came from  it is from an alien civilization a couple of block away from our solar system then this might be all we will ever know we cant travel there i know i wont be alive when we visit other star weve sent a reply in 2012 even though it wa a bit weird but that will take year and year to reach im about 99 certain we will probably never get a reply or if we did we probably wont be looking for it for the next 20 year or so when the reply would reach u  are just so many thing here but to the question ha there been any other explanation that can still hold up i know the comet one ha been pretty much debunked so is there anything else that could be on the table besides alien or are we at the greatest discovery of human history and we didnt even know it 40 year ago if thats the case it didnt take u too long to find alien if it is ,iesb3q,ive heard about the wow signal for a little while now and researching more about it ive deduced it is a strong candidate for an alien transmission either accidental or intentional i believe the first  know it is in the realm of possibility somewhat but the problem with this is we are in a submarine with no periscope we cant see the outside world to see any type of life in the ocean we can only hear or detect thing   is why it impossibly hard to detect thing in space the wow signal could be alienlife but there is no telescope to zoom in to even see the planet or solar system or alien ship if it wa some message deep in space we dont know if this wa from a message million of year old traveling from another galaxy even dont know what we are dealing with but it seems that we know that this ha all the checkmarks for an alien radio transmission that either turned on or shut off when one of the feedhorns on the bigear wa looking at it we dont know where exactly the noise came from  it is from an alien civilization a couple of block away from our solar system then this might be all we will ever know we cant travel there i know i wont be alive when we visit other star weve sent a reply in 2012 even though it wa a bit weird but that will take year and year to reach im about 99 certain we will probably never get a reply or if we did we probably wont be looking for it for the next 20 year or so when the reply would reach u  are just so many thing here but to the question ha there been any other explanation that can still hold up i know the comet one ha been pretty much debunked so is there anything else that could be on the table besides alien or are we at the greatest discovery of human history and we didnt even know it 40 year ago if thats the case it didnt take u too long to find alien if it is ,0

i think i had an encounter 2 year ago it happened when i wa watching 3 cherry red orb moving across the sky i will explain it from the beginning i am sort of a wildlife fan and go out regularly at night to spot owl deer fox and other wildlife in my area i live in a coastal area with dune and a small forest 1 night i wa cycling to the dune to spot some fox that where active in the area at the time mating season i wa standing on the top of a dune when i noticed three cherry red orb hovering stationary over the sea and quite in the distance initially i thought they could be aircraft coming in to land at the airport because i see them regularly flying the same approach path i paid little attention to it and continued to watch for fox about 10 minute went by when i noticed 1 of the orb going away from the remainder of the two and wa apparently coming closer to the coastline  it moved through the sky without flashing light or any change in brightness not flickering like a chinese lantern would this movement continues for about 5 minute and then it stopped i found this unusual and i got the thought well maybe this isnt an airplane at the time it wa still pretty far away from me 10 kilometer or more i think when it suddenly started moving again along the coastline coming towards my position the other 2 orb where still hanging above the ocean stationary but this one wa coming towards me at this moment my attention wa completely on this red orb it came closer and closer until it stopped about 500 meter from my position maybe le but it wa at night and i couldnt make a good estimate of the distance i wa just staring at this thing hovering completely silently above the dune prety close to me it had a constant brightness and a cherry red glow not like a light but just appeared cherry red i guess that about 5 minute went by when it appeared to come down a bit and then stopped again at this point i got a bit nervous because i could not explain it rationally maybe it nothing but at this time all the frog bird and other critter went dead silent i continued staring at this thing going over in my head what i could be when i suddenly heard some movement to my left i looked immediately to my left to see what appears to be a small figure not taller than 150cm looking at me i couldnt see a neck but only the shape of a head big in contrast to a human torso and arm that appeared relatively long i must admit i got frightened so i run towards my bike and sprinted away a fast a i could i looked back while sprinting away to see this red orb slowly following me for about 10 minute at a distance of about 100 meter i think i sprinted a fast a i could on my bike until i reached some populated area at this point the orb suddenly wa nowhere to be seen i must admit that i immediately went to my house  i couldnt sleep for two day after this and for fear of ridicule i havent told anybody except a good friend of mine this i still cannot explain what happened that night so thats why i post this now here and maby get some more answer on this one i am thinking about this experience almost every day i hope you guy can help me out a bit ,ielh43,i think i had an

i recently watched a video about alien and i wa thinking about how alot of people who claim to have been abducted seem to remember something happeng to their genital area then i thought that the alien probably took unfertalised egg and sperm sample so that they could breed their own supply of human so they didnt need to keep coming back they could then use this supply of people to run test they could do any kind of test they wanted because they person ha no connection to earth so they wouldnt have to be returned so they could dissect them or see what temperature is fatal  how long it take to starve and so on i dont know could be a dumb idea but just wanted to share it ,ieknjx,i recently watched a video about alien and i wa thinking about how alot of people who claim to have been abducted seem to remember something happeng to their genital area then i thought that the alien probably took unfertalised egg and sperm sample so that they could breed their own supply of human so they didnt need to keep coming back they could then use this supply of people to run test they could do any kind of test they wanted because they person ha no connection to earth so they wouldnt have to be returned so they could dissect them or see what temperature is fatal  how long it take to starve and so on i dont know could be a dumb idea but just wanted to share it ,0

just got reddit and wanted to share my experience this happened in northern ontario canada in august 2015 a video recreation can be found here  wa staying up at my cottage alone for the week it wa a hot night and i couldnt sleep so i decided to take a pillow and lay on the shoreline to watch the star after a few minute i saw a satellitetype object coming out of the south horizon it moved at variable speed hovering at time making small loop moving straight at time very erratic it continued moving this way until it wa directly overhead took around 15 min total to travel that distance then it slowly made it way back towards the east cottage is on an isolated bay with open water for about a km until there are 2 island a i wa watching this first object i saw a bright light glowing through the tree of the right island then a white orb roughly 25 foot in diameter came into view nothing blocked my line of sight it crossed the open section of water while making no noise it illuminated the shoreline while hovering at a constant 510 foot above the water and followed the shoreline of the left island island is under 100 foot before disappearing around the far side of the island light could still be seen glowing through the tree it then came into view once more a it crossed the open water in the opposite direction a the first time in view for roughly 1 minute it did not land or stop did not see it come down or go up after this event there were around 10 object similar to the first scattered throughout the sky at varying altitude i continued watching for over an hour before going inside to go to the bathroom when i came back out they were gone didnt seem like a ship of any kind they were just glowing white sphere but without a distinct place they were glowing from more like a gradient of bright in the middle fading to dimmer at the outside however the one that were farther away sometimes seemed to give the impression of facing a certain direction even then it wa unclear any distinct shape but more of a feeling this started happening i didnt have my phone on me so in a desperate attempt to leave some sign i took coin out of my pocket and laid them in a long line in case i disappeared i remember thinking that the end of the world come slowly a i sat there waiting to see what would happen at one point i ran inside to get my water bottle and a peach thinking it might be my last meal afterwards still not knowing what would happen i quickly texted my parent that i wa at peace and happy luckily im still here to share this story experience ha left me with a lot of unanswered question i dont know whether it wa a ship or not whether it wa being piloted or not whether it came from earth or not ha anyone else had something like this happen to them how did you

ok  so after my last post on rspace i decided to take matter into my own hand and come up with a principle a formula that would allow me to determine of  how many potential hot alien are there around in our observable  universe assume worst case scenario i guess first letter are in bold font so you can follow with these abbreviation  all averagesized galaxy    all dwarf galaxy    average number of star in one averagedsized galaxy    average number of star in one dwarf galaxy    number of all star in all averagedsized galaxy    number of all star in all dwarf galaxy    number of all star in the observable universe    average number of planet orbiting a single star    number of all planet orbiting their star in the observable universe    percentage number of right swipe on tinder in my case in other word how many girl i personally find hot within overall population    chance for a humanlike hot female in the average solar system   number of hot female in the observable universe    number of hot female on earth    overall earth population    percentage number of female in overall population    percentage of hottest age span in overall population    number of habitable planet with potential hot peoplelike creature on them there are around 150 billion by billion i mean 109  averagesized galaxy in our observable universe i assumed on  average they have like 50 the number of star of our milky way so  around 100 billion there are around 3000 billion dwarf galaxy in this very same universe each of them may have around 100 milion star  last i checked pluto wa considered not to be a planet of a solar  system so we have 8 planet in our solar system this mean that on  average each of star in the universe may have around 8 planet orbiting  them for star within dwarf galaxy ill reduce the number to 4  out of these 8 planet within our solar system only one of them ha  intelligent humanlike life exists unless deep under the ice of  europa moon something alive exists but even if thats the case i  doubt it would be in a humanlike form let alone hot form and is  capable of producing hot female or male but im not that interested  in hot male so ill focus on counting female in this example of a  principle in use therefore i estimate each star in the universe ha 8  planet orbiting it and one of them is capable of producing humanlike  specie 18 chance the  number of hot female on earth based on my preference hovers around  210 or 150 to 110 withing the overall population to simply the  matter ill use 5 or 120 a an example this number will remain  constant throughout universe so let actually jump to the math now this is the estimated number of hot female on earth  a i said there are nearly 8 bilion people a of now around 50 of  them are female then around 30 of them are within age 1835 the  hottest age span id say based on estimation of my preferance there a  chance id find 5 of them hot so  eop pfop  phasop  pnrst   8 billion 50  30  5  60 million  60

milion star  last i checked pluto wa considered not to be a planet of a solar  system so we have 8 planet in our solar system this mean that on  average each of star in the universe may have around 8 planet orbiting  them for star within dwarf galaxy ill reduce the number to 4  out of these 8 planet within our solar system only one of them ha  intelligent humanlike life exists unless deep under the ice of  europa moon something alive exists but even if thats the case i  doubt it would be in a humanlike form let alone hot form and is  capable of producing hot female or male but im not that interested  in hot male so ill focus on counting female in this example of a  principle in use therefore i estimate each star in the universe ha 8  planet orbiting it and one of them is capable of producing humanlike  specie 18 chance the  number of hot female on earth based on my preference hovers around  210 or 150 to 110 withing the overall population to simply the  matter ill use 5 or 120 a an example this number will remain  constant throughout universe so let actually jump to the math now this is the estimated number of hot female on earth  a i said there are nearly 8 bilion people a of now around 50 of  them are female then around 30 of them are within age 1835 the  hottest age span id say based on estimation of my preferance there a  chance id find 5 of them hot so  eop pfop  phasop  pnrst   8 billion 50  30  5  60 million  60 million number will be the number of hot female on each of the habitable planet in the universe the total number of star in all averagesized galaxy

i think the only thing that the earth needed wa a specific moon to facilitate the condition needed for life a we know it since the moon is likely hollow based on seismic test where it rang like a bell it possibly an artificial satellite created by alien billion of year ago they may go around to many planet creating thing to support life i have very little basis for this theory but feel it is very possible ,icj5xr,i think the only thing that the earth needed wa a specific moon to facilitate the condition needed for life a we know it since the moon is likely hollow based on seismic test where it rang like a bell it possibly an artificial satellite created by alien billion of year ago they may go around to many planet creating thing to support life i have very little basis for this theory but feel it is very possible ,0

    one is the most eventful by far  
 before i started i stated my intention they were fulfillment peace clarity and understanding i started meditating and went into a fairly deep state of concentration but the meditation seemed really long even thought it wa only 20 minute after i finished meditating i projected my intention to whoever wa there and became very emotional because i really wanted to be guided and know that i am not alone in this universe i went to the window and started scanning the night sky for about 5 minute and then i saw something blink in the middle to right side of my field of view or visible portion of the sky from my window it wa like a star blinked so i immediately looked at it and started focusing on that area i waited for about 30 second and then it blinked again at this point my heart started pounding very fast at the thought that i a mere human made a freaking ufo come above me to single it presence i wa like “holy shit” for pretty much the whole thing and when the third blink happened i wa convinced that this object wasn’t a plane or comet because it wa stationary it didn’t move an inch every time it blinked my fear subsided and i looked again and then it blinked a fourth and final time i stayed my head glued to the star trying to see if the object is going to blink again but it didn’t it just disappeared

🤦 i noticed a post from a few hour back blow up with comment and upvotes titled  the pentagon ha offworld vehicle not made on this earth the government ufo program ha revealed  which made me flinch

poster of that post but allow me to explain is mainly because even those video expose from fox and others from cnn  here cnn segment 1   and  here cnn segment 2  did not get down to the fine detail of what the known in the public domain evidence is that dr eric davis wa primarily mentioning so i present you with a picture of one of a few sample of that offworld technology sample micro layered magnesiumzincbismuth sample is referred to in yesterday video  here offworld ufo disclosure  and ha some extensive report covering the web of intrigue surrounding them involving player like to the star academy linda moulton howe and the u army  the best and most detailed report i have seen come from thedrive  here metamaterials indepth article  these sample have been doing the round for a few year now and what make them unique is their isotopic ratio showing they were not manufactured on earth  a good scientific article about isotopic ratio is  here 5 page pdf scientific expose isotopic  the layering method is so fine and so thin that we currently do not have machining technology available to reproduce the production method without creating layer intermixes on the nanoscale level which are found not to occur in the sample in layman term the layering is of the material is so accurate that even on the nanoscale the division between material is perfect with not crossing over into other layer while this may seem like a new revelation to you these sample have been doing the round since the day of art bell being on coasttocoastam  so they have a history and apparently several similar sample are in the hand of linda moulton howe and member of the to the star academy a well a allegedly others  according to several individual involved these sample are coming from the outer hull of craft that were recovered by the u government some made mention of the roswell craft under certain condition of experimentation these sample have been found to be perfect superconductors there is a lot of uncorroborated hearsay and conjecture involved but let attempt to sidestep that and move into an actual papertrail are image of the first and subsequent page of a contracted agreement for their study from the department of the army scroll down 1 of u army  ttsa crada study agreement contract sec ii see this in full go  here ttsa crada doc  report  now to further unravel this dr eric davis stated that he briefed a dod agency about recovered offworld technology  but it make more sense if he briefed a department which he had an extensive background in that being the aerospace industry of which he ha been a contractor  so if not the dia which would be the next obvious choice then it is my guess that he in fact briefed the u air force on the u army crada research involvement in the metamaterial sample fragment research which isnt such a strange thing to occur considering the many layer of compartmentalized information dealing within and between the two dod department the truth is that up to now we do not know who he briefed but most certainly we can be sure that the metamaterials were involved in the briefing and so from where did they come a crash retrieval and if so

who else ha dead money in their portfolio here’s a few from my portfolio aside from some run up early on in the pandemic gilead ha done nothing but drop this year i wa able to sell some covered call on price and iv spike on the headline regarding remdisivir and other potential treatment been holding and adding since 2015 average price  80 per share if it ever get back into the 75 range again i’ll start selling covered call with an 8250 strike fortunately i’ve been able to abate most of my loss from the dividend payout and covered call premium i’ve collected over the last 5 year  everyone’s favorite dead money stock i have held att on and off for the last 10 year and i initiated a new position in 2017 for the dividend at around 38 my plan wa to run the wheel strategy on this i got into 200 share through assigned put and sold a few covered call against my position while watching it slowly drop to 30 it’s sitting below 27 now and i’m selling 29 call just hoping to get assigned and take the loss att is beloved for the dividend 208 annually or 77 but it fcf per share 152 doesn’t cover it this is a classic yield trap in my opinion i would love to see them turn it around and pay off that debt but i’m not getting my hope up   i know exxon mobile is getting a lot of love in rstocks lately because it’s been beaten down so much but take it from someone who ha owned it since 2008 it’s dead money i believe it will recover from here but it’s got a long way to go to get back to my 84share average even if i tally up every dividend that i’ve received over the last 12 year it still wouldn’t be enough to cover my unrealized loss on this position the dividend is probably going to get cut folk so if you’re buying this it shouldn’t be because of the yield it should be because you believe in an oil recovery and can afford to wait it will come back but they have to get their financial house in order first  kushco wa my “pick and shovel” play in the marijuana gold rush unfortunately it didn’t pan out they diluted the shit out of the common stock by using it a a fund raiser and they got burned on chinese tariff and poor planning they failed to adequately anticipate demand and ended up having to air freight a bunch of product out of china to fulfill order which i believe hurt their competitive position by allowing leaner company to fill the demand vacuum i hope they come back and i’m willing to wait fortunately i don’t have a huge stake  don’t i just sell those the problem is they’re all longterm loss and i don’t have enough longterm gain to offset i would be capped at 3000 pretty quick all my gain this year are shortterm resulting from option selling i also don’t really need the money fortunately so i am just bag holding and waiting to see what happens if any of these start to approach my cost basis i’ll start selling covered call if any of these get assigned i’ll take the money and buy spy which is what i should have done in the first place stock picking is fun but i would be light year ahead if i had simply bought spy or some other broad market etf  what is your dead money what wa your rationale for entering that position and what’s your

hi so my mom ha been inspired by investing success over the last 3 month ive earned 40 return in 3 month a compared to the market 10 over the same period and ha asked me to invest her money for her ira i have most of the stock figured out amzn aapl fsly docu pypl sq se wmt nee fvrr lulu and nvda however i wonder if i should include luv andor dal in her portfolio also worth noting is that only half of her ira money will be in stock the other half will be in etf belief is that luv is simply the better stock they have a better balance sheet and equally importantly they are a leisurefocused airline a core assumption im using is that while leisure travel is a temporary loser of the covid19 pandemic business travel a much a i hate to say it is a permanent loser of it yeah it will still be around but it will most likely be a permanently smaller part of the aviation industry going forward and you can thank zoom for that there wa a motley fool article written back in august about how zoom is the biggest longterm threat to airline and i agree however i know that this is no guarantee it really a question of if the economic benefit of inperson meeting are greater than the travel expense and honestly i have no way to know if thats true i have a family friend who work at goldman sachs so next time i get to talk to him ill ask him about this even if business travel doe recover though it will be a far slower recovery than for leisure travel so ultimately whether the first assumption is true or not it can be confidently said that leisure travel will win out during these year of recovery and possibly beyond there is also a case to be made for dal the main lure i see for them is the general care toward their passenger that i have not seen from the other 2 major airline american and united these thing add up and i could see them luring some uppermiddleclass leisure traveler who have money to invest in a higher quality flight but are concerned about the virus and disease in general so even if delta business traveler dont return they can still come back up because of those new wealthier leisure traveler these traveler are also likely to be some of the same worker that can do remote work a lot of the time so they will have more time off to travel which strengthens that case even more if delta can win some of that market they could definitely do well in the future do you guy think thank you in advance i hear that you guy are concerned that im investing my mother money in the market i completely understand this and i am aware that however id like to be clear that she told me i can do this i am also using motley fool to help guide me so i am not on my own here also for the question of this post i basically told her that she can do what she want in

it seems alot of people dont know much about this company am up 11000 in this company in gain and i do plan to sell half of my share once nio reach 43 i will keep the other half of the share in the company for long term purchased nio 100 share at 630 in april 2020 right before the ev hype but sold them at 730  due to speculation on ev hype tanking nio ha been only buy and hold this year month of research and opinion and later i drove a tesla this year for the first time i purchased a tesla cybertruck 100 pre order i think electric vehicle are truly the future and ice company are long behind the trend even though these ice company are moving to ev many dont have the tech and customer likeness that tesla ha ice company will struggle getting their loyal customer to switch to ev vehicle while tesla never needed that switch in fact tesla is actually stealing ice customer and ha been for year can go ahead and assume tesla owner are not going to go back to a ice vehicle unless it wa for financial situation and vehicle space be honest i i wouldnt pay 45k for a small model 3 sedan when i could just buy a large crew cab luxury ram for 40k which is why the cybertruck at 49k is a very attractive buy because thats only 5k more than a model 3 and a way more practical vehicle in my eye i do actually haul and tow time to time with my parent business but i am a salesperson at a large fca dealership in my city tesla vehicle lose 10 value each year compared to 20 in ice vehicle to nio they  have 3 vehicle right now with a recent model that wa released mid of 2020 they will have another vehicle released january 6th 2021 on nio day thats 2 new vehicle released in one year span bring it to a total of 4 vehicle this is relatively easy for them because they dont actually own a single factory they pay jac motor to build them vehicle they are backed by the government the chinese government i vested 11 billion dollar into their company 2 month ago if they agreed to relocate their headquarters in hefei china it about 200 mile west of shanghai china they are the only other ev with actually reasonable vehicle for consumer the ceo and founder is william li he is a billionaire who also cofounded a publicly traded company named bitauto bita it an auto review company in china they have over 100 station in china that swap battery for new fully charged one in 5 min their negative quarterly margin is shrinking very fast and if the rate continues they will have positive profitable margin by next year william li said october 10th nios vehicle production target is 150000 total sale and he want to double that to 300000 by end of 2021 they have an auto driving feature called nio pilot   inhouse developed nio pilot empowered by mobileye eyeq4 boast over 20 driver assistance feature and support firmwareovertheair update always evolving always uptodate they have nio service which are van with battery that can charge an ev on the go if you run out of electricity on the side of the road they are limited to 5000 vehicle per month by jac motor jac motor is the company that actually make the nio vehicle the nio es6 is a high comparable vehicle to the tesla model x with simalir pricing nios reported customer loyalty referral is 3 time higher than tesla in china nio bass battery a a service is a subscriptionbased battery service where you will be able upgrade capacity in the future it includes the battery swapping station they have placed around city there is all the main info i found about this car company i really think if it will thrive in the future a long a they dont screw it up it risky of course just like tesla the main reason i think we will see nio reach tesla in china is because the chinese culture is just like american culture we love seeing made in usa product just like they love seeing made in china product think that people were forced to buy tesla in china because the chinese people didnt have a choice but now that nio is starting to look like the next battery started ev company we can see them overcoming tesla in china in the next 5 year i will also say that tesla vehicle are more efficient in their vehicle in many way i still think nio will thrive in china news nio earnings is late october this month and people are expecting about 180 increase from last year quarter 3 however when nio post the same earnings for quarter 2 they share price actual dropped but i think now that nio got big publicity this past week i think it will have the opposite effect this late october and day trader will turn into long term investor when they realize this company is on par to be what tesla wa 5 year ago want to point out that nio option interest are 85 call option which mean it opposite of tesla situation and 85 of people are expecting the share price to gain but this isnt really a good thing a once the option expire we might see a sell off dip then i think we will see a dip by and a slow sideways trade for 2 week till the next earnings report cant even imagine what i would have been buying today if i put 53k into nio 4 month ago instead of 600 😃 😅 would be up 400 today and at a value of 200000 what do you guy think

"i’d like to preface this post by stating this is my first proper dd that i’ve publicly submitted i’ve been a follower of rstocks for nearly 4 year now mostly lurking and absorbing information this is my way of thanking this community for helping me begin my investment journey and helping me mature into financial adulthood i also think it’s necessary for me to make this point because lately i’ve noticed a concern with new account attempting to pump hyln which isn’t my intention nor is it something that i approve of a it lead to volatility i plan to hold hyln longterm at the very least until i can avoid shortterm capital gain tax before i start accepting some of my gain  i begin i want to emphasize that this is not a pump stock the shortsellers need to stop treating it a one if you invested in this stock during the merger then short of accepting your loss you are now a longterm investor 12 year consider it a lesson learned and perhaps one that will pay for itself  the meat  explaining hyliion  pronounced hileeon stand for hybridlithiumion theyre a company located in austin tx and led by a young ceo by the name of thomas healy they offer electrified powertrain conversion system for class 8 fleet semitrucks effectively converting a diesel or natural gas powered semitruck into a hybrid by replacing the powerhouse of the rearmost rearaxle with a batterypowered axle think “toyota prius” functionality but on a larger scale  also preparing a rollout of their fully electric semitruck known a the hypertruck erx their product are designed to improve performance and lower cost of ownership while leveraging the alreadyexisting alternative fuel infrastructure  hype factor surrounding the company appears to have helped potential client pursue their company with interest instead of their company chasing client i see this a a huge win for them a doe thomas healy 1  hype factor for better or worse found it way into the retail investor’s strategy a well the stock price climbed 500 within a few month despite being due for a correction many gambled on the hypothesis that the price would continue to rise after the merger unfortunately the week prior and during the merger resulted in a lot of unplanned activity leading to an increase in volatility during the merger there were eight proposal that hyliion wa pushing to be approved prior to completing the merger and being listed on the stock exchange all passed but one proposal 3 proposal 3 wa set to classify the board of director however this proposal failed to pas by popular vote of the investor for the general reason summarized by one large investor below  large investor kevin jenkins of utah advisor said his firm voted against proposal three in order to balance power between stockholder and the board a classified board can make it harder for stockholder to force change on a company when thing go wrong jenkins cited recent trouble at nikola a a recent example of such conflict 2
 immediately resulted in the initial downward trend of the stock’s price there wa a lot of uncertainty in the air surrounding the merger and the future of the company false rumor stating that “the merger cannot pas without this proposal” surfaced leading to more fear for the newterm future and caused doubt for many retail investor hyliion extended the voting exclusively for proposal 3 by an additional two day to recount and offer additional time to vote for those who didn’t proposal 3 failed again and once again the price of the stock dropped the key to what happened on wednesday however is that hyliion confirmed that the merger would still be taking place on that friday and the ticker would change to hyln at some point in the following week for all brokerage the timing varies between them this all seemed to line up once again until the unexpected happened at the worst time the thursday evening prior to the ticker change president trump confirmed via twitter that he tested positive for covid19 the market tanked and hyliion wa hit about a hard a you could imagine  the merger went through and now we can move onto talking about what this company offer for the future of the class 8 semitruck industry

 2 the hypertruck erx the erx this is their fully electricdrive truck the rear axle is driven solely by an electric motor with battery cell provided by toshiba and packaged and managed inhouse by hyliion 8 when the truck’s battery power is low an underthehood generator turn on converting renewable natural gas produced by biowaste to charge the battery thus delaying the need for a gridcharge this result in the hypertruck erx producing netnegative carbon emission  9 of their investor presentation offer the following comparison between their hypertruck erx tesla’s batteryelectric vehicle bev and nikola’s scam product
  truck offer 1300 mile of range with a larger payload than the competition and shorter recharging time than a tesla
  3 the battery  software battery packaging module and management system software controlling the functionality of the battery are built inhouse by hyliion the lithiumion battery cell are sourced from toshiba  software is a key product that appears to be overlooked by many investor the software work off of driving habit and location to allow for a more efficient battery life prolonging drivability between refuels a well a increased efficiency and the pat on the back  knowing that youre utilizing renewable resource  thomas healy ha stated that one of their company’s goal is to work with the battery cell that are provided to them and configure the functionality of the battery with their software to outlast the truck lifespan instead of evolving the battery they are evolving the software that can make the currentexisting technology better is a list of target customer do with this information what you will a most of them have not been confirmed at this time but being focused on such heavy hitter provides a very positive outlook for the investor  the logistics company “agility” ha confirmed a preorder of 1000 hypertruck erx vehicle featuring a 5000 deposit per truck the initial fleet demonstration vehicle are expected to be delivered at some point in 2021 with volume shipment scheduled for 2022 for all client agility also invested in hyln premerger wegmans a grocer that offer 103 store and two distribution center across seven state ha paired with hyliion for their cng conversion product they recently purchased two brand new volvo cng semitrucks one that is being used to test the hyliion cng conversion system wegmans statement on this product is quoted a “a true performance game changer that give the truck enough torque and horsepower to pull a tandem set” 13 prior to hyliion’s conversion system the only truck they had that could pull a tandem set were dieselpowered wegmans ha a history of pushing for renewables their assuring stance on hyliion’s product bodes well for  hyliion’s company investor and their future client  penske is another target client that recently purchased into the conversion product they started with converting three truck with the remainder being delivered throughout the year 14 saving the dessert for last this is not a confirmed client but this wa a very interesting find to come across in the beginning of this video showing off the erx wa youtube  removed  i didnt realize i cant use youtube link in my post instead please reference the screenshots below  if youre interested feel free to pm me for the actual link to the video  you look closely you’ll see what appears to be an heb a supermarket grocery chain based in san antonio texas semitruck an image i pulled from the internet that show what their semitruck look like in full  may only be the beginning of the rumor but it seems likely that heb is testing hyliion’s conversion product after all they are on hyliion’s “target customers” list featured in the image at the beginning of this section 
 should begin this segment by stating that at this moment hyliion doe not have any competition when it come to hybrid conversion technology for class 8 semitrucks   ha plan to build batterypowered semitrucks at the cost of 200000 per truck with an expected range of 500 mile compared to hyliion’s 1300 mile with the erx i think that they are a very competent competitor however they have many fine line left to iron out and like hyliion the strength of their position in this sector is still completely unknown they’re dominating the retail consumer ev market but that can’t be compared to the truck market i also don’t believe that autonomous trucking will become the norm any time soon lobbyist and lawsuit will push this back for year if not decade an advantage for hyliion here is timing theyre ahead of the game with their product already available for testing analytics and purchase my dd i’ve found myself reading trucking blog and watching trucking vlogs i’ve noticed that truck driver tend to be “old school” and particular people i can’t imagine that the interior minimalistic quality that tesla is known for will be popular with those client chain like walmart won’t care what their trucker like or dislike which render this point moot in that sense however the many smaller chain and retail driver will consider this point in their decision  motor under investigation by the sec amid fraud allegation and the ceo trevor milton ha since stepped down from his position within the company not only that but gm have pushed back their contract to renegotiate their term given the company’s recent headline in the news at this moment i dont think it reasonable to consider their company a competitor to anyone can’t trust someone’s dd unless if it contains some potential negative about the company so i couldn’t expect you to read through mine without knowing what concern i have about hyliions future they’re a newly offered company that’s only a few year old with a young unproven albeit ambitious and driven ceo how will he handle the title of youngest billionaire how will he handle potentially delayed earnings in the future will he reallocate fund properly in his company how doe he interview his potential peer and under what basis doe he hire on their revenue wont ramp up for at least a year they’re expecting 1000000 in revenue by the end of 2020 and 8000000 by 2021 the expected earnings increase at an ambitious rate and right now we don’t know how competently the company will be run in the long term their expected earnings from 20202024 can be seen here   their social medium presence isnt up to par with what the investor were expecting thomas healy ha promised to be more active on social medium but people want more he went from never posting anything to posting once every couple of week people are expecting a trevor milton tier of pumping which they wont receive but i think itd be nice to hear from him a bit more often so that we know he still alive at least obtaining a closer relationship with your investor is never a bad idea either i noticed that hyliion is looking for a vp of marketing at this moment perhaps that person will assist here  you made it this far i commend you and appreciate your time we’re here to become better trader and if you have any critique or correction regarding my dd i’m happy to acknowledge them  some of my source were removed i didnt realize that youtube link cannot be referenced in post i understand the reasoning people will pump their own channel but it an inconvenience here if anyone want the direct link i am happy to pm them to you the background to hyln and how they came to ipo ha also been removed under rule  if anyone is interested in the full detail regarding their merger feel free to message me directly  removed  oiseapproveshyliiondeal       removed removed removed           ",jbdjnu,"i’d like to preface this post by stating this is my first proper dd that i’ve publicly submitted i’ve been a follower of rstocks for nearly 4 year now mostly lurking and absorbing information this is my way of thanking this community for helping me begin my investment journey and helping me mature into financial adulthood i also think it’s necessary for me to make this point because lately i’ve noticed a concern with new account attempting to pump hyln which isn’t my intention nor is it something that i approve of a it lead to volatility i plan to hold hyln longterm at the very least until i can avoid shortterm capital gain tax before i start accepting some of my gain  i begin i want to emphasize that this is not a pump stock the shortsellers need to stop treating it a one if you invested in this stock during the merger then short of accepting your loss you are now a longterm investor 12 year consider it a lesson learned and perhaps one that will pay for itself  the meat  explaining hyliion  pronounced hileeon stand for hybridlithiumion theyre a company located in austin tx and led by a young ceo by the name of thomas healy they offer electrified powertrain conversion system for class 8 fleet semitrucks effectively converting a diesel or natural gas powered semitruck into a hybrid by replacing the powerhouse of the rearmost rearaxle with a batterypowered axle think “toyota prius” functionality but on a larger scale  also preparing a rollout of their fully electric semitruck known a the hypertruck erx their product are designed to improve performance and lower cost of ownership while leveraging the alreadyexisting alternative fuel infrastructure  hype factor surrounding the company appears to have helped potential client pursue their company with interest instead of their company chasing client i see this a a huge win for them a doe thomas healy 1  hype factor for better or worse found it way into the retail investor’s strategy a well the stock price climbed 500 within a few month despite being due for a correction many gambled on the hypothesis that the price would continue to rise after the merger unfortunately the week prior and during the merger resulted in a lot of unplanned activity leading to an increase in volatility during the merger there were eight proposal that hyliion wa pushing to be approved prior to completing the merger and being listed on the stock exchange all passed but one proposal 3 proposal 3 wa set to classify the board of director however this proposal failed to pas by popular vote of the investor for the general reason summarized by one large investor below  large investor kevin jenkins of utah advisor said his firm voted against proposal three in order to balance power between stockholder and the board a classified board can make it harder for stockholder to force change on a company when thing go wrong jenkins cited recent trouble at nikola a a recent example of such conflict 2
 immediately resulted in the initial downward trend of the stock’s price there wa a lot of uncertainty in the air surrounding the merger and the future of the company false rumor stating that “the merger cannot pas without this proposal” surfaced leading to more fear for the newterm future and caused doubt for many retail investor hyliion extended the voting exclusively for proposal 3 by an additional two day to recount and offer additional time to vote for those who didn’t proposal 3 failed again and once again the price of the stock dropped the key to what happened on wednesday however is that hyliion confirmed that the merger would still be taking place on that friday and the ticker would change to hyln at some point in the following week for all brokerage the timing varies between them this all seemed to line up once again until the unexpected happened at the worst time the thursday evening prior to the ticker change president trump confirmed via twitter that he tested positive for covid19 the market tanked and hyliion wa hit about a hard a you could imagine  the merger went through and now we can move onto talking about what this company offer for the future of the class 8 semitruck industry

"there a seeking alpha article i think is good not allowed to link on this sub that make some article i make they basically go through the holding and debt and compare it to the market cap to figure out how discounted it is the number they arrived at a few month ago wa a 35 discount the crown jewel of softbank group is obviously alibaba which they own about 22 of then they own a big chunk just sold down to around 40 i believe of softbank corp a major japanese telecom company and a chunk of tmobil article is a little old and there ha been some stuff sold i also think theyre a little pessimistic on some of the valuation of some of the privately held stuff softbank group themselves estimate the value per share of the share traded in tokyo are 12973 yen per share currently traded at 6521 yen so just about half what the underlying value is the truth of the privatelyheld valuation is probably somewhere inbetween the two estimate but you can go line by line and evaluate for yourselves
 worth addressing is the conventional argument for why it so low which is that masayoshi son make apparently insane decision sometimes which i wont dispute but i think the story that make the headline have a disproportionate impact on the market cap relative to the actual exposure that the decision have on shareholder example the wework issue were really bad but this wa all in the vision fund which wa only 30 or so funded by softbank group and the shareholder the rest wa arab oil money with softbank managing it in softbanks own shareholder value estimate the entire vision fund wa 1458 yenshare or 11 but it seemed to me to cause a disproportionate drag on the stock price for month and probably still is  other obvious example is when people found out that softbank wa doing massive derivative trade the share price dropped and they lost 9 billion in market cap over 4 billion in trade i guess it higher risk that what most company do with their extra cash but when you have 10 of billion of liquid asset you have to do something with it buying stock of desirable company seems like a reasonable way to keep it liquid to me
 onto some other stuff that i like about the company  it go through the arm sale is solid and softbank would get a roughly 215 billion stake in nvidia which is a nice asset to sit on a minor footnote that might turn out to be a bigger deal is that softbank is keeping an iot company arm had acquired

 couple of other le talked about asset that i think are worth noting for their growth potential are softbanks near50 stake in yahoo japan which is the most commonly used search engine in japan still the world 3rd largest economy and it actually powered by google another is paypay competing to be the fintech app in japan and currently ha the highest marketshare the other is that they own boston dynamic a i understand outright hard to say how near they are to producing significant revenue but theyre still a world leader in robotics technology it could just be a matter of time before they find the right partner and application and it becomes huge part of vision fund there are a number of highgrowth company that took a real hit due to coronavirus but with the cash to weather the storm i still think will turn out to be solid in a few year including uber 15 stake oyo hotel grab se asian superapp multiple partner and paytm indian fintech 20 among lot of others i actually think the biggest danger with these is giving up too soon on company that are in the process of capturing marketshare and softbank ha a ton of cash for continuing fund 2 is starting up with all the cash from recent asset sale and seems focused on higher tech smaller company which i think is a good strategy considering there are no partner recently including biofurmis digital therapeutic shipbob warehouseshipping for vendor listing on multiple website and xtalpi ai in medecine and the guy that manages it just announced today that theyre starting a special acquisition company there an activist investor hedgefund eliott management involved a a watchdog pushing for share buyback and oversight the fuckup are sort of priced in and there a lot to like ",ja99iz,"there a seeking alpha article i think is good not allowed to link on this sub that make some article i make they basically go through the holding and debt and compare it to the market cap to figure out how discounted it is the number they arrived at a few month ago wa a 35 discount the crown jewel of softbank group is obviously alibaba which they own about 22 of then they own a big chunk just sold down to around 40 i believe of softbank corp a major japanese telecom company and a chunk of tmobil article is a little old and there ha been some stuff sold i also think theyre a little pessimistic on some of the valuation of some of the privately held stuff softbank group themselves estimate the value per share of the share traded in tokyo are 12973 yen per share currently traded at 6521 yen so just about half what the underlying value is the truth of the privatelyheld valuation is probably somewhere inbetween the two estimate but you can go line by line and evaluate for yourselves
 worth addressing is the conventional argument for why it so low which is that masayoshi son make apparently insane decision sometimes which i wont dispute but i think the story that make the headline have a disproportionate impact on the market cap relative to the actual exposure that the decision have on shareholder example the wework issue were really bad but this wa all in the vision fund which wa only 30 or so funded by softbank group and the shareholder the rest wa arab oil money with softbank managing it in softbanks own shareholder value estimate the entire vision fund wa 1458 yenshare or 11 but it seemed to me to cause a disproportionate drag on the stock price for month and probably still is  other obvious example is when people found out that softbank wa doing massive derivative trade the share price dropped and they lost 9 billion in market cap over 4 billion in trade i guess it higher risk that what most company do with their extra cash but when you have 10 of billion of liquid asset you have to do something with it buying stock of desirable company seems like a reasonable way to keep it liquid to me

good saturday morning to all of you here on rstocks i hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and is ready for the new trading week ahead is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning october 12th 2020 earnings could be a positive force for stock a washington continues to wrangle over stimulus   source stock market optimism for a stimulus package ha been rising but the focus swing to earnings and that could be a positive for stock in the week ahead jpmorgan citigroup goldman sachs bank of america and morgan stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate report there is also some important data including cpi inflation data tuesday and retail sale for september on friday “it look like earnings season might turn out better than expected based on early reports” said ed keon chief investment strategist at qma “the guidance look pretty good so we have earnings season upon u the stimulus talk go back and forth and it look like maybe there’s a will to get something done” on friday afternoon the white house raised it offer for at stimulus package to 18 trillion but wa still below the 22 trillion sought by democrat “it’s really hard to read” said keon but he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now there should be a package after the election regardless of who win  “i actually put some money to work in small cap on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few month from now you do want to own economically sensitive stocks” said keon“we’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuation are not cheap but compared to the 10year treasury yield at le than 80 basis point stock don’t look that bad” stock in the past week had their best performance since early july with the sp 500 up 38 at 3477 the small cap russell 2000 wa up 64 the 10year treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 070 to a high a 079 friday yield move opposite price and the 10year yield ha now broken out of a range it been stuck in below 070 earnings could provide positive momentum for stock if company continue to beat estimate at a healthy pace like last quarter “q2 reporting season saw sp 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate both in term of breadth 85 and size 20 prompting historically rare strong upgrade to forward estimate especially for the cyclicals and one of the strongest earnings season rally on record” wrote deutsche bank strategist the summer earnings rally came before the big september decline which took the sp 500  down about 10 the sp 500 is up more than 8 since sept 24 “while the bottomup consensus for q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings the bulk of it is being driven by reduction in loan loss provision and energy sector loss excluding these underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up 15 to 13 despite rising q3 gdp growth estimate pointing to a strong macro rebound” they noted the deutsche strategist said the question remains however whether the market will respond to earnings beat or election uncertainty keon said the market ha been moving up a former vice president joe biden extended his lead in the poll because there’s le chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate lead according to realclearpolitics he wa leading president donald trump by 97 percentage point from just about  6 point at the beginning of the prior week “i think from the market’s perspective it doesn’t really matter who win a long a we have a clear winner” said keon “i think the direction of the poll are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few day after that the risk of a messy contested election is going down and the market is relieved by that” tom block washington analyst at fundstrat said trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his reelection effort “there are many moving part here and they’re all moving in different

know to get you ready for the trading week beginning october 12th 2020 earnings could be a positive force for stock a washington continues to wrangle over stimulus   source stock market optimism for a stimulus package ha been rising but the focus swing to earnings and that could be a positive for stock in the week ahead jpmorgan citigroup goldman sachs bank of america and morgan stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate report there is also some important data including cpi inflation data tuesday and retail sale for september on friday “it look like earnings season might turn out better than expected based on early reports” said ed keon chief investment strategist at qma “the guidance look pretty good so we have earnings season upon u the stimulus talk go back and forth and it look like maybe there’s a will to get something done” on friday afternoon the white house raised it offer for at stimulus package to 18 trillion but wa still below the 22 trillion sought by democrat “it’s really hard to read” said keon but he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now there should be a package after the election regardless of who win  “i actually put some money to work in small cap on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few month from now you do want to own economically sensitive stocks” said keon“we’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuation are not cheap but compared to the 10year treasury yield at le than 80 basis point stock don’t look that bad” stock in the past week had their best performance since early july

10year yield ha now broken out of a range it been stuck in below 070 earnings could provide positive momentum for stock if company continue to beat estimate at a healthy pace like last quarter “q2 reporting season saw sp 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate both in term of breadth 85 and size 20 prompting historically rare strong upgrade to forward estimate especially for the cyclicals and one of the strongest earnings season rally on record” wrote deutsche bank strategist the summer earnings rally came before the big september decline which took the sp 500  down about 10 the sp 500 is up more than 8 since sept 24 “while the bottomup consensus for q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings the bulk of it is being driven by reduction in loan loss provision and energy sector loss excluding these underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up 15 to 13 despite rising q3 gdp growth estimate pointing to a strong macro rebound” they noted the deutsche strategist said the question remains however whether the market will respond to earnings beat or election uncertainty keon said the market ha been moving up a former vice president joe biden extended his lead in the poll because there’s le chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate lead according to realclearpolitics he wa leading president donald trump by 97 percentage point from just about  6 point at the beginning of the prior week “i think from the market’s perspective it doesn’t really matter who win a long a we have a clear winner” said keon “i think the direction of the poll are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few day after that the risk of a messy contested election is going down and the market is relieved by that” tom block washington analyst at fundstrat said trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his reelection effort “there are many moving part here and they’re all moving in different directions” said block “it’s not impossible a deal come together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on friday afternoon because of the mixed signal that have come out over the last seven day from the white house” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ha opposed a large package and the two side have been stalemated “i think the president belief that he will be helped by having a signed

i find it strange and compelling with all the reach i’ve done how research in psychology can relate to alien article that will speak about emotion and the role on our physical body how fear can control and freeze u fear can control like how the grey use fear to stop they’re victim dead in their track in lot encounter make them unable to move with fear some people even say like a wave of fear human produce emotional energy which can be measured and be detected with technology a common a house hold router and the wifi in our home  good article by harvard on that the grey must use some sort of emotional mastery of energy to use fear because it’s so wired into human our fight or flight response so they can control u when need be with it in the book behold a pale horse it talk about how to break free from a grey control with happy pleasant thought because it confuses them our emotion produce a energy or residency of some sort that supposedly the reptilian race feed off of from a higher up dimension the main energy of lust and sexual energy what the bible considers sin but also hate and fear that dimension being the astral plane where the reptilian feed off of u some say a higher plane then that but i doubt so they keep u away when our body naturally start to slip into the plane through sleep paralysis by scaring u showing u what we fear to keep u out of their plane of existence where they feed on u because sleep paralysis and astro projection are on the same plane and thing sleep paralysis is the in unpurposeful projection i think the demon and begin that sit on our chest and scare u do it on purpose but for what reason to keep u away again back to fear we fear to go and we stay away we have become a race of physical minded people we don’t see astroprojection a a place or reality anymore more of a dream and forget about the experience rationalize it we’re 23 physical an 13 spiritual now when thousand of year ago even hundred of year ago we were more interconnected with our spiritual self but now we are desensitized to it what is real is only physical real life if you well reality is only what you can see an touch we are taught why would that be again to keep u blind and unaware unaware to our spiritual self and unaware of being used there’s so much more to all of this and these are only simple connection just off the top of my head something i just want to get out and see what others think or see these connection a well it’s hard to explain and i see so many that i can’t even try to explain them all like the god particle or the ether that nikola tesla and albert einstein talked about a nonphysical ether and in the nature volume some time in 1970s  they published a test where they proved that there is a nonphysical source of energy or realm the god particle the ether the astro plane it’s non physical not touchable we can prove that there are place other then physical reality but we’re not taught that but it doe exists and it ha been proven and published it’s not talked about the connection the more i learn the more i see them even with cell phone tower and our emotional energy and state of being i’ve read cia document talking about how they could induce astroprojection with frequency played aloud auditory beat remote viewing i’ve read cia document where they hide cell phone tower a tree in the 60 and when asked what they were for they said for state of emergency control over the mass population they would produce frequency to calm everybody if anyone know that document send me it i lost it but it’s real

hi all am in the middle of reading dr john mack book abduction about his extensive research with individual who have experienced alien abduction what i found interesting is that all of the case that ive read so far involve people who have been abducted in the middle of the night usually accompanied by sleep paralysis i have never been abducted myself but i experience sleep paralysis rather frequently which is usually followed by an outofbody experience where i am able to float around my bedroom and house float through the ceiling window and wall sometimes see other being in my room not alien but rather spirit or being who are dark and somewhat transparent during sleep paralysis i used to experience a menacing presence such a a dark figure in my room the hat man or an evil being sitting on my chest trying to suffocate me however after some time these negative experience associated with sleep paralysis stopped now whenever i get sleep paralysis i just leave my body and explore this other strange realm my personal encounter with sleep paralysis and outofbody experience astral projection i am convinced that this other world i experience when i leave my body is another reality perhaps another dimension in many way it feel and look like the real world but at the same time it is slightly off and different i am fully aware and conscious through the whole experience a if i wa in my real body considering the similarity between sleep paralysis and alien abduction im wondering if alien abduction occur in this other dimension a well i know that some people who have experienced humanoid encounter outside the context of nighttimesleep recalled that the being used some sort of tool to paralyze them so that they could not move but their consciousness remained intact and they were aware of what wa going on to me this sound very similar to the experience of sleep paralysis where your body is paralyzed but your mind is completely aware guess i am just thinking aloud and trying to organize my thought around this but i really feel that abduction and perhaps all ufo phenomenon come from a different dimension however the phenomenon is able to manifest itself physically in this dimension a well which would explain our ability to sometimes detect ufo on radar or capture photograph and video of it  i am familiar with jacques vallees interdimensional hypothesis which ha influenced a lot of my own view stated here thanks for reading i would be curious to know your thought and if anyone ha experienced abduction and sleep paralysis on separate occasion id be curious to know what your experience wa like and what you think the connection is between these two phenomenon  just wanted to add that a lot of abductees recall being floated by alien being out of their bed through the wallsceilings of their house this is the same thing that happens when i leave my body due to sleep paralysis i am also able to float through solid object  also some abductees recall hearing a loud vibrating sound when the abduction experience begin likewise many people hear the same sound when they enter sleep paralysis and right before they are able to leave their body

first thing first i have an unshakable belief beyond wishful or religious in the existence of alien life in the form of intelligent being this belief wa refined over the year with the study of the phenomenon the book my inclination to ancient history that brought me to the not so refined work of von daniken but which in turn led me to zacharia sitchin and many others this is not a recent phenomenon my phobia nightmare fuel and simultaneous fascination with aliensufo ha been there since my very first memory i have a constant feeling that i do not remember something and if i do recall it i am not completely certain that these are fabricated memory from dream or my young imagination following are some of the earliest memory i have between age 6 and 1213 in italy very first recurring nightmare wa of having a picnic with my parent in a green grass park next to tree when suddenly 4 to 5 tall men in grey suit at the time i associated them to the enemy of the power ranger putty patroller please check for image on google would grab me and take me away recurring dream especially when i had a fever wa of runningdrivingflying uncontrollably fast in specific one of being on someone shoulder while he ran reaching absurd speed can not be one 100 sure but i have crosschecked this next point with my mother who seems to remember something of the sort i remember waking up with 9 round brownish burned looking mark on the stomach this memory came flooding back after watching a documentary on the falcon lake incident and seeing similar mark on one of the abductees my childhood i have been sick on a regular basis almost monthly with very high and sudden fever in this age range i have vague memory of symbol scratched onto my window but i still dismiss them today a just dirt an obsession with spotting satellite and a lasting fear of the dark to this day i find it difficult to fall asleep unless some movie or show is playing on my laptop following is from age 1314 to 1920 i am 31 year old france where i have lived for about 10 year we have a large enough property with a modern chalet style house in the middle of a large garden surrounded by tree at night from the very beginning i could hear heavy step running around the house from my ground floor bedroom the step would get fainter a they went around and louder a they approached closer to my room the time the step took to run around the house in circle wa too fast weirdly fast something worth mentioning is the stomping wa clearly of two distinct footstep and not of an animal running on all four this happened every night throughout the 810 year i have lived there with my mom this time i can not recall if it wa while the running sound wa happening our garden developed a fairy ring quite large in diameter between 34m i have read about them and even if the name implies something fairy related the explanation is of a fungus colony that take the ring like shape nonetheless given all of the above i thought it worth of mention one of the summer spent in italy when i wa small i have witnessed something i still can not explain and i wa not alone while with a friend at his grandparent house playing in the back yard we could see the lit light of the 3 story house in front of his in particular one window wa lit in yellow light with the horizontal shade open and the outline of a man with both his hand up on the glass and his finger moving a if playing with the shade i turned to look at my friend who in turn looked at me freaked out we both turned our head towards the window and the same shadowy outline with it hand up on the window and it finger playing with the shade no longer had it head it wa headless and still moving we ran away immediately terrified i have spoken to him about it 2 month ago the same bedroom mentioned earlier one night while fully awake and conscious something quite silly but terrifying took place i wa trying my best to fall asleep a i had school the next morning and one voice a loud a hear my finger typing now said in my ear youre a penguin i do not claim a connection with anything and i do not know if the voice in my head or rather in my ear said something that sounded like that or if in fact perhaps i am a penguin i did not sleep that night and i now wonder what my brain interpreted that voice to be saying something worth mentioning is after telling the story to my father he said that shortly before he woke up from a voice shouting in his year 67 again do not know that it mean if it mean anything or if you heard of similar account have what i believe to be a small cyst in my arm i can feel it and hold it between my finger it feel mobile i do not doubt that it is exactly that a cyst that i should probably get it removed but in the spirit of full disclosure i have thought on multiple occasion what if it isnt i am 31 i have an incredible girlfriend who belief me and a family who doesnt disbelieve me i am passionate and studious in the phenomenon i have the book and they taught me about history the manuscript of jung who in it part taught me about philosophy and psychoanalysis i have the military document from more trustworthy source greer and others and le so tom delonge in any case the strangeness quieted down since i moved to the middle east in 2015 but it hasnt stopped and my interest is boiling inside me more than ever just writing all of it down for the first time clarifies and sharpens memory and i am sure i missed a few i am studying the region for historical feature which could be connected to the phenomenon and i have found rock carving in oman clearly depicting grey within human recently my mother found a very strange foot of what we guess could be an animal in the same garden in the house in france the skin is white and bloodless the texture is chicken like but the size is too big and wide to be an avian week the light in my apartment in dubai turned on in the middle of the night while with my girlfriend driving a low light orb wa on top of my car and a i wa looking at it it suddenly shot forward disappearing at the horizon move to the middle east ha brought a lot of positive energy a if lifted from something i have started to go to the gym very regularly my mind feel sharp i am eating well and am driven on my career i have a fantastic relationship with my girlfriend and i feel good

the w56 the alien who ate fruit the incredible case of friendship ha reemerged de lama is a swiss family in the group that met extraterrestrial in pescara in the 1960s  the incredible fact  which began in 56 and lasted over 20 year  of alien who became friend of a group of earthling including a swiss family are in our time the subject of renewed attention the friendship case is undoubtedly one of the most interesting and important in the history of modern ufology a dozen people lived a long friendly relationship with a community of extraterrestrial mainly in pescara where they were based the meeting lasted from 1956 to 1978 human nicknamed the alien community w56 an acronym for long live 56 the real name of these alien  human in appearance of various height and from different galaxy  is akrij in sanskrit the sage this story or legend depending on your point of view remained unknown to the mass until 2007 when the book “contattismi di massa” by stefano breccia one of the group wa published since then there ha been growing attention not only among scholar but also among the general public there are no more interview and conference which sometimes last until 2 in the morning so much is the interest of the people to which one of the living witness 97yearold gaspare de lama is called in many region of italy the fact he narrated are reviving that debate that wa once held in secret only between expert  de lama why is there never indisputable evidence of the existence of alien is not a science even if it concern it closely nor a faith therefore it is foolish to expect impossible reproduction in the laboratory with our poor terrestrial mean just a it is foolish to believe without criterion perhaps the correct attitude is given only by the awareness that inconceivable thing happen with respect to the parameter of our current knowledge we can only see 5 percent of the material let alone if we understand the remaining 95 percent » the friendship case resurfaces strongly after so many year whats underneath is the simple fact that the time are a little more mature they are more mature why dont these friend finally manifest themselves to all of u the time are not so ripe a to allow all of humanity to bear a truth like this a truth that ha always been covered up and ridiculed » go to 1956 what happened happened that some alien who lived in a secret base in pescara manifested themselves to some terrestrials a few year later in milan where i wa directing a wellknown art gallery i became friend with bruno sammaciccia the exponent of the terrestrial group who with caution revealed to me the fact that were happening in pescara it changed my wife and is life both being painter therefore with an open and sensitive mind we were very happy to ascertain this personally the alien accepted u into the group and we spent year learning the way of their friendship  mean witnessed not only their surprising manifestation due to a technological level unthinkable for u but i also learned their way of life even if they always repeated that they were not perfect in our eye all their action appeared motivated only by love towards humanity and the earth which they call “the mother planet” » start with their technology summary they do not travel in time a some ridiculous earth science argues to deny the ufo phenomenon but between dimension therefore the message sent into space by our power with primitive mean that require an infinite time to reach the galaxy are useless the alien already know everything about u they are able to dematerialize and move themselves and object they predict shortterm they are telepathic the w56 knew our thought in 2007 they answered a question of mine their spaceship are huge laboratory which a they wish show or hide from our view they are expressed in our language ​​ all thanks to a technology acquired over million of year of evolution we dont even get to the first step of their experience » their so to speak spiritual sphere incomparable to ours the w56s have a friendly demeanor they fight very rarely and immediately find the way to make peace for them to do harm is inconceivable they dont eat meat but they always asked u for fruit a well a other food such a vegetable they extracted vitamin » me were they asking you for food instead of materializing them in an instant wanted this affectionate human collaboration of ours the friendship the love they wanted to instill in u served a a form of vital energy for them the uredda their technology is based on this energy so we realized that we human do not know what love is » of them sigir taught me love is when you dont exist others exist impossible for u  » 1962 his photo of a ufo became famous meeting were possible with the w56s

,iytcyq,the w56 the alien who ate fruit the incredible case of friendship ha reemerged de lama is a swiss family in the group that met extraterrestrial in pescara in the 1960s  the incredible fact  which began in 56 and lasted over 20 year  of alien who became friend of a group of earthling including a swiss family are in our time the subject of renewed attention the friendship case is undoubtedly one of the most interesting and important in the history of modern ufology a dozen people lived a long friendly relationship with a community of extraterrestrial mainly in pescara where they were based the meeting lasted from 1956 to 1978 human nicknamed the alien community w56 an acronym for long live 56 the real name of these alien  human in appearance of various height and from different galaxy  is akrij in sanskrit the sage this story or legend depending on your point of view remained unknown to the mass until 2007 when the book “contattismi di massa” by stefano breccia one of the group wa published since then there ha been growing attention not only among scholar but also among the general public there are no more interview and conference which sometimes last until 2 in the morning so much is the interest of the people to which one of the living witness 97yearold gaspare de lama is called in many region of italy the fact he narrated are reviving that debate that wa once held in secret only between expert  de lama why is there never indisputable evidence of the existence of alien is not a science even if it concern it closely nor a faith therefore it is foolish to expect impossible reproduction in the laboratory with our poor terrestrial mean just a it is foolish to believe without criterion perhaps the correct attitude is given only by the awareness that inconceivable thing happen with respect to the parameter of our current knowledge we can only see 5 percent of the material let alone if we understand the remaining 95 percent » the friendship case resurfaces strongly after so many year whats underneath is the simple fact that the time are a little more mature they are more mature why dont these friend finally manifest themselves to all of u the time are not so ripe a to allow all of humanity to bear a truth like this a truth that ha always been covered up and ridiculed » go to 1956 what happened happened that some alien who lived in a secret base in pescara manifested themselves to some terrestrials a few year later in milan where i wa directing a wellknown art gallery i became friend with bruno sammaciccia the exponent of the terrestrial group who with caution revealed to me the fact that were happening in pescara it changed my wife and is life both being painter therefore with an open and sensitive mind we were very happy to ascertain this personally the alien accepted u into the group and we spent year learning the way of their friendship  mean witnessed not only their surprising manifestation due to a technological level unthinkable for u but i also learned their way of life even if they always repeated that they were not perfect in our eye all their action appeared motivated only by love towards humanity and the earth which they call “the mother planet” » start with their technology summary they do not travel in time a some ridiculous earth science argues to deny the ufo phenomenon but between dimension therefore the message sent into space by our power with primitive mean that require an infinite time to reach the galaxy are useless the alien already know everything about u they are able to dematerialize and move themselves and object they predict shortterm they are telepathic the w56 knew our thought in 2007 they answered a question of mine their spaceship are huge laboratory which a they wish show or hide from our view they are expressed in our language ​​ all thanks to a technology acquired over million of year of evolution we dont even get to the first step of their experience » their so to speak spiritual sphere incomparable to ours the w56s have a friendly demeanor they fight very rarely and immediately find the way to make peace for them to do harm is inconceivable they dont eat meat but they always asked u for fruit a well a other food such a vegetable they extracted vitamin » me were they asking you for food instead of materializing them in an instant wanted this affectionate human collaboration of ours the friendship the love they wanted to instill in u served a a form of vital energy for them the uredda their technology is based on this energy so we realized that we human do not know what love is » of them sigir taught me love is when you dont exist others exist impossible for u  » 1962 his photo of a ufo became famous meeting were possible with the w56s

so this might seem kinda dumb but i feel like human will discover an alien ship which can travel at the speed of light or even faster and we will learn their technology and start to build out own ship we will say that we have achieved ftl travel but we wont say that it wa alien who helped u some human would probably make a deal with alien to not show their existence the alien would probably have a translator for language sound straight out of a science fiction movie i know but i feel like this is actually realistic like there is probably more of a chance that if the government said alien doe exist they would more than likely massacre u for resource the only reason why they wouldnt is if the government made a deal with them and not expose them to the public ,id78u3,so this might seem kinda dumb but i feel like human will discover an alien ship which can travel at the speed of light or even faster and we will learn their technology and start to build out own ship we will say that we have achieved ftl travel but we wont say that it wa alien who helped u some human would probably make a deal with alien to not show their existence the alien would probably have a translator for language sound straight out of a science fiction movie i know but i feel like this is actually realistic like there is probably more of a chance that if the government said alien doe exist they would more than likely massacre u for resource the only reason why they wouldnt is if the government made a deal with them and not expose them to the public ,0

im not sure if this is the right place for this since i cant determine if this is a ufo subreddit or one about the genuine search for life of our current effort ive been wondering is there really any point to it im not debating the usefulness of finding alien i mean what could we really know even if we did find an exoplanet with life on it how could we study it it not like we could look at the alien through a telescope or collect sample from their homeworld yeah we may know that alien are there but then what whats the followup we could do nothing more it would be the end of the search for extraterrestrial life beyond our solar system yeah we could find more planet but so what how many people do you know of that care when a new exo planet is discovered the only time it ever make the news is if the planet may be habitable yeah an inhabited planet may be an interesting discovery but thats because it would be new nobody going to care if it becomes the norm  only thing that would really be worthwhile is finding life within our own solar system of course the chance of that are slim and it appears scientist are falling back on the speculation of laypeople that alien may be hiding inside europa and other icy moon i dont see the point in scanning extrasolar planet to see if they may have life it not like we could know more than that theyre there and to be honest we would never know that 100 just because we dont understand why a planet atmosphere ha a strange chemistry to it doesnt mean there isnt a nonbiological explanation i mean scientist cant even explain the chemistry of the atmosphere of body within our own solar system yeah they have no explanation for the chemistry of the atmosphere of venus and titan but youre still labeled a crackpot if you say it must be alien unless we seriously take a sample of these world atmosphere and check them for germ well never know 100 if these world host life we obviously cant do that with an extrasolar planet  i think the only search for alien life should stick to world we can at least send probe to of course operation like seti are also a worthwhile endeavor even if theyve come up completely empty despite decade of searching either way it would probably be a wise idea to keep a lookout for any possible invader we may or may not be able to do much about them but having forwarning is better than nothing i just think searching for life outside the solar system is pointless and were not technologically advanced enough to really get anything out of it until we can send probe out to the star we should probably stick to searching for radio signal and doublechecking our own solar system for life ,j9ojrv,im not sure if this is the right place for this since i cant determine if this is a ufo subreddit or one about the genuine search for life of our current effort ive been wondering is there really any point to it im not debating the usefulness of finding alien i mean what could we really know even if we did find an exoplanet with life on it how could we study it it not like we could look at the alien through a telescope or collect sample from their homeworld yeah we may know that alien are there but then what whats the followup we could do nothing more it would be the end of the search for extraterrestrial life beyond our solar system yeah we could find more planet but so what how many
